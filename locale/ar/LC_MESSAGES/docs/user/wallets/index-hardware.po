"A hardware wallet is a type of device which stores private keys for a "
"blockchain in a secure hardware device, instead of in a database file "
"such as wallet.dat used with common software wallets. This offers major "
"security advantages over software wallets, as well as practical benefits "
"over paper wallets. To date, there is no verifiable evidence of hardware "
"wallets being compromised by viruses, and they are also immune to "
"keylogger attacks that could be used to steal passwords to unlock the "
"private keys used with software wallets."

"Hardware wallets function by storing your private keys in a protected "
"area of a microcontroller. It is impossible for the private key to leave "
"the device in plain text - only the signed output of the cryptographic "
"hash is ever transmitted to the device interacting with the blockchain, "
"such as your computer or smartphone. Most hardware wallets feature a "
"screen which allows you to independently confirm the address you are "
"sending to is correct."
