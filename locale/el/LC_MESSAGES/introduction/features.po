"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash's attempt to solve "
"two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance"
" in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no"
" central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such "
"decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. "
"The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once (yes/no/abstain) for "
"each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be implemented (or not) by "
"Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash's Core Team "
"submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be "
"increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve "
"this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been"
" raging for nearly three years."

msgid ""
"DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other"
" projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses 10% "
"of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is "
"mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and "
"the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the "
"month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal "
"receives net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the"
" end of the month a series of \"superblocks\" will be created. At that time,"
" the block rewards that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used "
"to fund approved proposals. The network thus funds itself by reserving 10% "
"of the block reward for budget projects."

"Transactions on the Dash network are recorded in blocks on the blockchain. "
"The size of each transaction is measured in bytes, but there is not "
"necessarily a correlation between high value transactions and the number of "
"bytes required to process the transaction. Instead, transaction size is "
"affected by how many input and output addresses are involved, since more "
"data must be written in the block to store this information. Each new block "
"is generated by a miner, who is paid for completing the work to generate the"
" block with a block reward. In order to prevent the network from being "
"filled with spam transactions, the size of each block is artificially "
"limited. As transaction volume increases, the space in each block becomes a "
"scarce commodity. Because miners are not obliged to include any transaction "
"in the blocks they produce, once blocks are full, a voluntary transaction "
"fee can be included as an incentive to the miner to process the transaction."
" Most wallets include a small fee by default, although some miners will "
"process transactions even if no fee is included."

"The release of Dash 0.12.2.0 and activation of DIP0001 saw a simultaneous "
"reduction of fees by a factor of 10, while the block size was increased from"
" 1MB to 2MB to promote continued growth of low-cost transactions even as the"
" cost of Dash rises. Dash 0.13.0.0 introduced InstantSend autolocks, which "
"causes masternodes to automatically attempt to lock any transaction with 4 "
"or fewer inputs — which are referred to as “simple” transactions — and "
"removes the additional fee for InstantSend. The current fee schedule for "

":ref:`PrivateSend` works by creating denominations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and "

" Mixing is free, but to prevent spam attacks, an average of one in ten "
"mixing transactions are charged a fee of 0.0001 DASH. Spending inputs mixed "
"using PrivateSend incurs the usual standard or InstantSend fees, but to "
"avoid creating a potentially identifiable change address, the fee is always "
"rounded up to the lowest possible denomination. This is typically .001 DASH,"
" so it is important to deduct the fee from the amount being sent if possible"
" to minimise fees. Combining InstantSend and PrivateSend may be expensive "
"due to this requirement and the fact that a PrivateSend transaction may "
"require several inputs, while InstantSend charges a fee of 0.0001 DASH per "
"input. Always check your fees before sending a transaction."
