"Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused "
"cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features :ref:`instant "
"transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, optional "
":ref:`privacy <coinjoin>` equal to that of physical cash and a :ref:`self-"
"governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` driven by "
":ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>`. While Dash is based on "
"Bitcoin, its two-tier network structure offers significant improvements in "
"transaction speed, privacy and governance. This documentation describes "
"these and many more key features that set Dash apart in the blockchain "
"economy."
