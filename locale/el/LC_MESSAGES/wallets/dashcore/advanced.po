"Since version 0.12.2.0, Dash Core has included an implementation of "
"BIP39/BIP44 compatible hierarchical deterministic (HD) key generation. This "
"functionality is only available from the command line by specifying the "
"``usehd`` option when starting Dash Core for the first time. Use this "
"function with care, since the mnemonic seed and keys will be stored in plain"
" text until you specify a wallet passphrase. Note that the wallet passphrase"
" is different to the mnemonic passphrase, which is often also referred to as"
" the \"25th word\" or \"extension word\". The wallet passphrase encrypts the"
" wallet file itself, while the mnemonic passphrase is used to specify "
"different derivation branches from the same mnemonic seed."
