"A paper wallet is a method of storing a private key to access funds stored "
"on a single address. It can be generated on a computer that has never been "
"connected to the internet, and printed out for air-gapped offline storage. "
"As such, they are suitable for storing large amounts of Dash, but care must "
"be taken not to lose the private key, since there is no way of recovering "
"funds if it is ever lost. To use the key, it must be imported or \"swept\" "
"into an online wallet and should not be used again. Paper wallets are "
"extremely secure but somewhat inconvenient for everyday use compared to "
"hardware wallets, which also offer a high degree of security."

"Paper wallets use random user and machine input to create a set of "
"keys/addresses which you then print. You can never regenerate a paper wallet"
" once you turn off the machine. What you print is all you get. For this "
"reason, paper wallets are somewhat vulnerable and require special care "
"because they can get damaged, lost, destroyed or stolen. Even if you encrypt"
" them with BIP38 (which you should), a sufficiently motivated adversary "
"(e.g. robbery/home invasion) could bypass this encryption using the "
"proverbial \"$5 wrench attack\"."

"While you can create a paper wallet using a machine that is connected to the"
" internet, wallets that will be used to store significant funds should be "

"A simple method of doing this is to burn a live Linux CD. `Ubuntu Desktop "
"<https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop>`_ is recommended because it will have "
"the most drivers and is simple to use, while `Tails "
"<https://tails.boum.org/>`_ and `Kali Linux "
"<https://www.kali.org/downloads/>`_ are popular choices for extremely strong"
" security. Booting from an actual CD is most secure since it is mounted "
"read-only, but a USB stick is generally fine as well. Both laptops and "
"desktops can be used if you can ensure that all networking hardware is "
"disabled when you get to the stage of actually generating your keys."
