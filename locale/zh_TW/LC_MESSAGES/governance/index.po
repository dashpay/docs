"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash's attempt to solve "
"two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance"
" in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no"
" central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such "
"decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. "
"The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once (yes/no/abstain) for "
"each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be implemented (or not) by "
"Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash's Core Team "
"submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be "
"increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve "
"this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been"
" raging for nearly three years and has resulted in serious splits within the"
" community and even forks to the Bitcoin blockchain."

"The DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While "
"other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses"
" 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is "
"mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and "
"the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the "
"month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal "
"earns the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at "
"the end of the month the requested amount will be paid out in a "
"\"superblock\". At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% "
"of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus "
"funds itself by reserving 10% of the block reward for budget projects."
