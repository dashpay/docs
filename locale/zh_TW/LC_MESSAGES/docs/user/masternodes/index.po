"Dash is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on user-friendly"
" payments and transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these "
"features are implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known as "
"masternodes, which gives rise to many exciting features not available on "
"conventional blockchains. These features include instant and private "
"transactions, as well as governance of the development of the Dash network "
"through a monthly budget and voting. This in itself is a first in the crypto"
" world, and the masternodes are necessary to achieve the privacy and speed "
"that Dash offers."

"This documentation focuses on understanding the services masternodes provide"
" to the network, but also includes guides on how to run a masternode, using "
"either a hosting provider or by setting up and maintaining your own hosting "
"solution. The primary requirement to run a masternode on the Dash network is"
" 1000 DASH. This is known as the collateral, and cannot be spent without "
"interrupting operation of the masternode. The second requirement is the "
"actual server running the Dash masternode software."

"Since operating your own server requires a certain level knowledge of "
"blockchains and Linux server operating systems, several community members "
"offer dedicated hosting solutions for a fee. Taking advantage of these "
"services means the user only needs to provide the masternode collateral and "
"pay the hosting fee in order to receive payment from the block reward. See "
":ref:`these pages <masternode-hosting>` for information on how to set up a "
"hosted masternode."

"Users with a deeper understanding (or curiosity) about the inner workings of"
" the Dash network may choose to operate their own masternode on their own "
"host server. Several steps are required, and the user must assume "
"responsibility for setting up, securing and maintaining both the server and "
"collateral. See these pages for information on how to set up a self-operated"
" masternode."
