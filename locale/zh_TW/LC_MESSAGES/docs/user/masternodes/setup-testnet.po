"A VPS, more commonly known as a cloud server, is fully functional "

"server. A VPS is ideal for hosting a Dash masternode because they typically "
"offer guaranteed uptime, redundancy in the case of hardware failure and a "
"static IP address that is required to ensure you remain in the masternode "
"payment queue. While running a masternode from home on a desktop computer is"
