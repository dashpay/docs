"Dash is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus on "
"the payments industry. Dash offers a form of money that is portable, "
"inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and in"
" person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin project, "
"Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments system in the "
"world. In addition to Bitcoin's feature set, Dash currently also offers "
"instant transactions (:ref:`instantsend`), private transactions "
"(:ref:`coinjoin`) and operates a self-governing and self-funding model that "
"enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses for work that "
"adds value to the network. This :ref:`decentralized governance and budgeting"
" system <governance>` makes it one of the first ever successful "
"decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)."

"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"is that transactions occur directly between two parties without any central "
"authority to facilitate the transaction. This also means that you are "
"responsible for your own security - there is no bank or credit card company "
"to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. In this sense, it"
" is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency can be spent locally and "
"internationally with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds "
"to the right destination. For these reasons, the Dash documentation has a "
"strong focus on safety and understanding the concepts and features that "
"drive the Dash ecosystem. The videos, links and documentation below can help"
" you get started, or use the table of contents on the left to find a "
"specific topic of interest."

"如果您對加密貨幣不熟悉，則你需要了解的最重要部份就是交易直接發生在兩個交易對手之間，當中沒有任何中央權力機構來促進交易。這也意味著您需要對自己的資金安全負責"
"--"
"如果您的資金被盜或丟失，沒有銀行或信用卡公司可以撤銷交易。從這個意義上說，它類似於現金或黃金，但如果您確保您將資金發送到正確目的地的話，則加密貨幣可以輕鬆使用在本地和國際消費上。出於這些原因，達世幣文檔強調安全性，與及理解能夠推動達世幣生態系統的概念和功能。下面的視頻，鏈接和文檔可以幫助您開始使用，或者使用左側的目錄查找感興趣的特定主題。"
