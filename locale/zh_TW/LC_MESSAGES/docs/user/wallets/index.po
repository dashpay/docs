"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is necessary."
" This applies to barter systems as well as economies using currency as a "
"medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a private ledger, "
"cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses on a distributed "
"public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access the balance stored "
"on each public address are therefore the object of value in this system. "
"This section of the documentation discusses different practical methods of "
"keeping these keys safe in wallets, while still remaining useful for day-to-"
"day needs."
