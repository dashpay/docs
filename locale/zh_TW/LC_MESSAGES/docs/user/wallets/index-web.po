"Web wallets are services which keep a Dash balance for you, while "
"maintaining control of the private keys on your behalf. Any Dash stored on "
":ref:`exchanges <exchanges>` falls under this category, but there are also "
"some services able to store Dash for you through simple Google/Facebook "
"login systems. Be extremely careful with web storage, as your Dash is only "
"as secure as the reputation of the company storing it for you. A particular "
"exception is MyDashWallet.org, which provides a secure web interface to the "
"Dash blockchain while leaving you with full control of your private keys."
