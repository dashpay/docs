"A hardware wallet is a type of device which stores private keys for a "
"blockchain in a secure hardware device, instead of in a database file such "
"as wallet.dat used with common software wallets. This offers major security "
"advantages over software wallets, as well as practical benefits over paper "
"wallets. To date, there is no verifiable evidence of hardware wallets being "
"compromised by viruses, and they are also immune to keylogger attacks that "
"could be used to steal passwords to unlock the private keys used with "
"software wallets."

"Hardware wallets function by storing your private keys in a protected area "
"of a microcontroller. It is impossible for the private key to leave the "
"device in plain text - only the signed output of the cryptographic hash is "
"ever transmitted to the device interacting with the blockchain, such as your"
" computer or smartphone. Most hardware wallets feature a screen which allows"
" you to independently confirm the address you are sending to is correct."
