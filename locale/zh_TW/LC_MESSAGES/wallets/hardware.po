"By virtue of its design, Trezor can be used to sign transactions on 'unsafe'"

"translates into 'vault' in most Slavic languages, including Czech. A kind of"
" 'vault' for your private bitcoin key, Trezor claims to use a number of "
"clever tricks to maintain security even on compromised and unsafe machines."
