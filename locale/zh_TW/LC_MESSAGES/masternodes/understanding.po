"Masternodes, once unique to the Dash network, are now becoming popular as "
"the technology is forked into other blockchains. This section of the "
"documentation describes the principles and mechanisms of masternodes and the"
" services they provide to the Dash network specifically."

#: ../../masternodes/understanding.rst:22

"Simply put, a masternode is a server with a full copy of the Dash "
"blockchain, which guarantees a certain minimum level of performance and "
"functionality to perform certain tasks related to block validation, as well "
"as PrivateSend and InstantSend, as the privacy and instant transaction "
"features in Dash are called. The masternodes are paid for this service, "
"using a concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition to the Proof "
"of Work done by miners to secure the blockchain. Masternodes are also "
"allowed to vote on :ref:`governance and funding proposals <governance>`, "
"with each masternode receiving one vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal "
"submitted to the system."

"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "
"decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant "
"fraction of the masternodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with "
"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 1000 Dash. The "
"coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need to be kept in a "
"certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves or"
" spends those coins, the masternode stops working and payment ceases."
msgstr ""

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the PrivateSend, InstantSend and "
"governance services they provide. 45% of the block reward is paid out to the"
" masternodes, 45% to miners and 10% to the budget. In practice, half of the "
"reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners. "
"Masternodes are selected for payment in each block (approximately every 2.6 "
"minutes) from a deterministic masternode list, and moved to the back of the "
"list after payment. As more masternodes are created, the duration between "
"payments increases. If the collateral behind a masternode is spent, or if a "
"masternode stops providing services to the network for more than one hour, "
"it is removed from the list until normal service resumes. In this way, "
"masternodes are given incentive to provide efficient and reliable services "
"to the network."

"Having so many servers holding a full copy of the blockchain and working for"
" the coin can be extremely useful. Thanks to the reward system, there is no "
"risk of not having enough masternodes, and the developers can rely on them "
"quickly deploying any new decentralized feature they want to implement. This"
" is where the true strength of Dash lies - an incentivized system of "
"thousands of distributed servers working 24x7 means that Dash can scale more"
" efficiently and deploy services more quickly than a blockchain run entirely"
" by unpaid volunteers. The more masternodes, the better and safer the Dash "
"network."
