"Dash is the first cryptocurrency to feature a concept called InstantSend "
"(transaction locking and masternode consensus). This technology will allow "
"cryptocurrencies to compete with nearly instantaneous transaction systems "
"such as credit cards for point-of-sale situations while not relying on a "
"centralized authority. Widespread vendor acceptance of Dash and InstantSend "
"could revolutionize cryptocurrency by shortening the delay in confirmation "
"of transactions from as long as an hour (with Bitcoin) to as little as a few"
" seconds."
