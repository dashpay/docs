"Transactions on the Dash network are recorded in blocks on the blockchain. "
"The size of each transaction is measured in bytes, but there is not "
"necessarily a correlation between high value transactions and the number of "
"bytes required to process the transaction. Instead, transaction size is "
"affected by how many input and output addresses are involved, since more "
"data must be written in the block to store this information. Each new block "
"is generated by a miner, who is paid for completing the work to generate the"
" block with a block reward. In order to prevent the network from being "
"filled with spam transactions, the size of each block is artificially "
"limited. As transaction volume increases, the space in each block becomes a "
"scarce commodity. Because miners are not obliged to include any transaction "
"in the blocks they produce, once blocks are full, a voluntary transaction "
"fee can be included as an incentive to the miner to process the transaction."
" Most wallets include a small fee by default, although some miners will "
"process transactions even if no fee is included."

"Transaktionen über das Dash-Netzwerk werden in den Blöcken der Blockchain "

"gibt keinen notwendigen Zusammenhang zwischen dem hohen Wert einer "
"Transaktion und der Menge an Bytes, die zum Ausführen benötigt wird. Die "
"Größe einer Transaktion hängt vielmehr von der Zahl der Inputs und Outputs "
"an, die verwendet werden, da durch diese mehr Daten in den Block "
"eingeschrieben werden müssen. Jeder neue Block wird von einem Miner "
"generiert, der für die Schaffung des Blocks mit dem Block-Reward belohnt "
"wird. Damit das Netzwerk nicht von Spam-Transaktionen überflutet werden "
"kann, ist die Größe eines Blocks limitiert. Wenn die Menge an Transaktionen "
"zunimmt, wird die Speicherkapazität des Blocks zu einem knappen Gut. Da "
"Miner nicht dazu verpflichtet sind Transaktionen in die Blöcke aufzunehmen, "
"kann eine freiwillige Transaktionsgebühr hinzugefügt werden, welche dem "
"Miner einen Anreiz bietet, die Transaktion zu verarbeiten. Die meisten "
"Wallets setzen von sich aus eine Transaktionsgebühr fest, auch wenn manche "

":ref:`CoinJoin` works by creating denominations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and "
