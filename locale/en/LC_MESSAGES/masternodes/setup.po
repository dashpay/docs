"A VPS, more commonly known as a cloud server, is fully functional "

"multiple systems on one physical server, making it more efficient and "
"much cheaper than having a single operating system running on the \"bare "
"metal\" of each server. A VPS is ideal for hosting a Dash masternode "
"because they typically offer guaranteed uptime, redundancy in the case of"
" hardware failure and a static IP address that is required to ensure you "
"remain in the masternode payment queue. While running a masternode from "
"home on a desktop computer is technically possible, it will most likely "
