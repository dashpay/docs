"Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition"
" there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In "
"Dash, such decisions are made by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization "
"(or DAO) consisting of the masternodes. The DAO allows each masternode to"
" vote once (yes/no/abstain) for each proposal. If a proposal passes, it "
"can then be implemented (or not) by Dash's developers. A key example is "
"early in 2016, when Dash's Core Team submitted a proposal to the network "
"asking whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 "
"hours, consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to"
" Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three "
"years and has resulted in serious splits within the community and even "
"forks to the Bitcoin blockchain."

"The DAO also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While"
" other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash "
"uses 20% of the block subsidy to fund its own development. Every time a "
"block is mined, 80% of the subsidy is split between the miner and a "
"masternode per the distribution found :ref:`here <block-reward-"
"reallocation>`, while the remaining 20% is not created until the end of "
"the month. During the month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the "
"network. If that proposal earns the net approval of at least 10% of the "
"masternode network, then at the end of the month the requested amount "
"will be paid out in a \"superblock\". At that time, the block subsidies "
"that were not paid out (20% of each block) will be used to fund approved "
"proposals. The network thus funds itself by reserving 20% of the block "
"subsidy for budget projects."
