"Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as Dash refers to the "

"problems as a method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of"
" mining creates new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. Mining is "
"possible on a range of hardware. Dash implements an algorithm known as "
":ref:`X11 <x11-hash-algorithm>`, which the miner must solve in order to "

"Dash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"Dash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners "
"attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when "
"they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the "
"blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the "
"problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and "
"the miner is rewarded."

"Dash works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a "
"two-tier network. The second tier is powered by :ref:`masternodes "
"<masternodes>` (Full Nodes), which enable financial privacy (CoinJoin), "
"instant transactions (InstantSend), and the decentralized governance and "
"budget system. Because this second tier is so important, masternodes are "
"also rewarded when miners discover new blocks. The breakdown is as "
"follows: 80% of the block subsidy is split between the miner and a "
"masternode per the distribution found :ref:`here <block-reward-"
"reallocation>`, while 20% is reserved for the budget system (created by "
"superblocks every month)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since "
"the masternodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the "
"entire network is overseen by the masternodes, which have the power to "
"reject improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the"
" entire block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the"
" Dash software, the masternode network would orphan that block, and it "
"would not be added to the blockchain."

"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. Masternodes power "
"the second tier, which provide the added features that make Dash "
"different from other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes do not mine, and "
"mining computers cannot serve as masternodes. Additionally, each "
"masternode is “secured” by 1000 DASH. Those DASH remain under the sole "
"control of their owner at all times, and can still be freely spent. The "
"funds are not locked in any way. However, if the funds are moved or "
"spent, the associated masternode will go offline and stop receiving "
