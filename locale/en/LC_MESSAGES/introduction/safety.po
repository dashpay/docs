"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to "
"understand in comparison with the traditional banking system is that "
"transactions occur **directly between two parties without any central "
"authority** to facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you are"
" responsible for your own security** - there is no bank or credit card "
"company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. If you"
