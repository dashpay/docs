"Masternodes, once unique to the Dash network, are now becoming popular as"
" the technology is forked into other blockchains. This section of the "
"documentation describes the principles and mechanisms of masternodes and "
"the services they provide to the Dash network specifically."

"Simply put, a masternode is a server with a full copy of the Dash "
"blockchain, which guarantees a certain minimum level of performance and "
"functionality to perform certain tasks related to block validation, as "
"well as InstantSend and CoinJoin, as the and instant transaction and "
"privacy features in Dash are called. The masternodes are paid for this "
"service, using a concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition "
"to the Proof of Work done by miners to secure the blockchain. Masternodes"
" are also allowed to vote on :ref:`governance and funding proposals "
"<governance>`, with each masternode receiving one vote (yes/no/abstain) "
"on each proposal submitted to the system."

"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "
"decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant "
"fraction of the masternodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with "
"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of DASH "
"collateral. The coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need "
"to be kept in a certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If"
" the owner moves or spends those coins, the masternode stops working and "
"payment ceases."

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the InstantSend, CoinJoin and "
"governance services they provide. 20% of the block subsidy goes to the "
"budget with the remaining 80% split between miners and masternodes per "
"this :ref:`block reward reallocation table <block-reward-reallocation>`. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 20% payout to the budget proposal "
"winners. Masternodes are selected for payment in each block "
"(approximately every 2.6 minutes) from a deterministic masternode list, "
"and moved to the back of the list after payment. As more masternodes are "
"created, the duration between payments increases. If the collateral "
"behind a masternode is spent, or if a masternode stops providing services"
" to the network for more than one hour, it is removed from the list until"
" normal service resumes. In this way, masternodes are given incentive to "
"provide efficient and reliable services to the network."

"Having so many servers holding a full copy of the blockchain and working "
"for the coin can be extremely useful. Thanks to the reward system, there "
"is no risk of not having enough masternodes, and the developers can rely "
"on them quickly deploying any new decentralized feature they want to "
"implement. This is where the true strength of Dash lies - an incentivized"
" system of thousands of distributed servers working 24x7 means that Dash "
"can scale more efficiently and deploy services more quickly than a "
"blockchain run entirely by unpaid volunteers. The more masternodes, the "
"better and safer the Dash network."
