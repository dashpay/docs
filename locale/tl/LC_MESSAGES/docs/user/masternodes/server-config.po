"Setting up a masternode requires a basic understanding of Linux and "
"blockchain technology, as well as an ability to follow instructions closely."
" It also requires regular maintenance and careful security, particularly if "
"you are not storing your Dash on a hardware wallet. There are some decisions"
" to be made along the way, and optional extra steps to take for increased "
"security."

"Commercial :ref:`masternode hosting services <masternode-hosting>` are "

"A VPS, more commonly known as a cloud server, is fully functional "
"installation of an operating system (usually Linux) operating within a "
"virtual machine. The virtual machine allows the VPS provider to run multiple"
" systems on one physical server, making it more efficient and much cheaper "
"than having a single operating system running on the \"bare metal\" of each "
"server."

"A VPS is ideal for hosting a Dash masternode because they typically offer "
"guaranteed uptime, redundancy in the case of hardware failure and a static "
"IP address that is required to ensure you remain in the masternode payment "
"queue. While running a masternode from home on a desktop computer is "
"technically possible, it will most likely not work reliably because most "
"ISPs allocate dynamic IP addresses to home users."
