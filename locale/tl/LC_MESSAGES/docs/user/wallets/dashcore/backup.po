"This documentation describes how to safely back up your wallet file for "
"safe storage in case your computer or laptop is damaged or lost. Dash "
"Core stores all data necessary to control your Dash addresses in a single"
" file called *wallet.dat*. This wallet is in the Berkeley DB format and "
"stores the pairs of private/public cryptographic keys used to manage your"
" balances on the Dash blockchain. For HD wallets, the mnemonic, "
"passphrase, and seed are also stored in *wallet.dat*. Dash Core makes "
"most of these operations transparent and even generates automatic backups"
" of your wallet file in case it is corrupted, but the user is responsible"
" for ensuring that these backups are stored in a safe place. **If you "
"lose access to your wallet file, you will permanently lose access to your"
" Dash.**"

"Finally it is important to understand that *wallet.dat* itself is a "

"that you are guaranteed access through any software supporting the "
"protocol, rather than a specific implementation of that protocol. If you "
