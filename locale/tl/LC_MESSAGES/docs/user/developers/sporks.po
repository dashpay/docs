"A multi-phased fork, colloquially known as a \"spork\", is a mechanism "
"unique to Dash used to safely deploy new features to the network through "
"network-level variables to avoid the risk of unintended network forking "
"during upgrades. It can also be used to disable certain features if a "
"security vulnerability is discovered - see the :ref:`features page <sporks>`"
" for a brief introduction to sporks."

"Enforcement of spork-controlled code can be activated remotely by members of"
" the core development team signing a network message using a relevant "
"private key. Should problems arise, the code can be deactivated in the same "
"manner, without the need for a network-wide rollback or client update. This "
"documentation describes the meaning of each spork currently existing on the "
"network, and how to check their respective statuses."

"Sporks are set using integer values. Many sporks may be set to a particular "
"epoch datetime (number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970) "
"to specify the time at which they will active. Enabled sporks are set to 0 "
"(seconds until activation). This function is often used to set a spork "
"enable date so far in the future that it is effectively disabled until "
"changed. The following sporks currently exist on the network and serve "
"functions as described below:"
