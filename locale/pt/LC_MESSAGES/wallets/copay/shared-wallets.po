"Normal transactions in Dash only need to be approved by the person sending "
"the funds. The Dash Copay wallet supports multisig, short for "
"multisignature, meaning that it is possible to require more than one key to "
"approve a transaction. This can be used like a joint checking account, or in"
" situations where majority approval from a board is required to create a "
"transaction. This documentation describes how to set up and use shared "
"wallets."

"Before you create a shared wallet, think about how many people should have "
"access to it, and how many of those people will be required to authorise a "
"transaction. Is it just one or two? Or a majority, or even everyone? Shared "
"wallets allow you to specify a total number of copayers and a required "
"number of signatures to create a transaction. These are often referred to as"
" M-of-N transactions, where for example 2-of-3 signatures are required to "
"transact. In practice, this is used to share responsibility for the funds "
"between several people. It is not possible require a certain person, such as"
" the manager, to be one of the copayers (although adding a password only the"
" manager knows can have the same effect). Shared wallets are inherently "
"risky because if more than the minimum required number of people involved "
"lose access to their keys, the funds will be inaccessible forever. Make sure"
" everyone understands the risks and responsibilities of shared wallets "
"before committing significant funds."

"Funds and addresses in shared wallets are managed separately from your "
"personal wallets, so you will need to create a new wallet and then add "
"copayers before you can begin creating transactions. From the **Home** "
"screen, click the + button at the top right to add a new wallet. Select "
"**Create shared wallet** and enter a name for the wallet, your own name, the"
" total number of copayers and the required number of signatures for a "
"transaction. Tap the **Create m-of-n wallet** button to create the wallet. "
"The wallet will appear with your other wallets, listed as **Incomplete** "
"until the copayers have joined."

"Tap the incomplete shared wallet when you are ready to add users. A QR code "
"will be displayed. Have your copayers scan the code or share it to them by "
"email or instant message by tapping the **Share invitation** button. Once "
"everyone has scanned the code and entered their name, the wallet is ready "
"for use. Simply tap the wallet to display addresses for receiving funds, but"
" note that the addresses begin with 7 instead of X to indicated they are "
"multisig addresses. It is possible to receive Dash to a shared wallet in "
"exactly the same way as a normal wallet. Only sending Dash requires "
"participation from the copayers."
