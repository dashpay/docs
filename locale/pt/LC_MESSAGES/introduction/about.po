"Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused "
"cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features :ref:`instant "
"transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, "
":ref:`anonymity <privatesend>` equal to that of physical cash, a :ref"
":`self-governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` driven "
"by :ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a `clear "
"roadmap <https://github.com/dashpay/dash-roadmap>`_ for on-chain scaling "
"to up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While "
"Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the "
"Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant "
"improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and governance. This section"
" of the documentation describes these and many more key features that set"
" Dash apart in the blockchain economy. For full details, please read "
"the `Dash whitepaper <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/wiki/Whitepaper>`_."
