"Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as Dash refers to the process "
"of searching for solutions to cryptographically difficult problems as a "
"method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of mining creates "
"new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. Mining is possible on a range "
"of hardware. Dash implements an algorithm known as :ref:`X11 <x11-hash-"
"algorithm>`, which the miner must solve in order to earn rewards. A number "
"of X11 ASICs are available on the market, which help make Dash secure "
"against brute force attacks on the blockchain."

"Dash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"Dash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners "
"attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when "
"they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the "
"blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the "
"problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the "
"miner is rewarded."
msgstr ""
"Dash, como Bitcoin e a maioria das outras criptomoedas, é baseado em um "
"livro de contabilidade descentralizado de todas as transações, conhecido "
"como um blockchain. Este blockchain é protegido através de um mecanismo de "
"consenso; no caso tanto o Dash e o Bitcoin, o mecanismo de consenso é prova "
"de trabalho (PoW). Mineradores tentam resolver problemas difíceis com "
"computadores especializados, e quando eles resolvem o problema, que recebem "
"o direito de adicionar um novo bloco para o blockchain. Se todas as outras "
"pessoas que executam o software concordam que o problema foi resolvido "
"corretamente, o bloco é adicionado para o blockchain e o minerador é "
"recompensado."

"Dash works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a two-"
"tier network. The second tier is powered by :ref:`masternodes <masternodes>`"
" (Full Nodes), which enable financial privacy (CoinJoin), instant "
"transactions (InstantSend), and the decentralized governance and budget "
"system. Because this second tier is so important, masternodes are also "
"rewarded when miners discover new blocks. The breakdown is as follows: 80% "
"of the block subsidy is split between the miner and a masternode per the "
"distribution found :ref:`here <block-reward-reallocation>`, while 20% is "
"reserved for the budget system (created by superblocks every month)."

"The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the "
"masternodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the entire "
"network is overseen by the masternodes, which have the power to reject "
"improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire "
"block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the Dash "
"software, the masternode network would orphan that block, and it would not "
"be added to the blockchain."
msgstr ""
"O sistema masternode é referido como Prova de Serviço (PoSe), uma vez que os"
" masternodes fornecem serviços cruciais para a rede. De fato, toda a rede é "
"supervisionada pelos masternodes, que têm o poder de rejeitar os blocos mal "
"formados dos mineiros. Se um mineiro tentasse levar a recompensa do bloco "
"inteiro para si ou tentasse executar uma versão antiga do software Dash, a "
"rede masternode ficaria órfã desse bloco, e não seria adicionado ao "
"blockchain."

"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. Masternodes power the "
"second tier, which provide the added features that make Dash different from "
"other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes do not mine, and mining computers cannot"
" serve as masternodes. Additionally, each masternode is “secured” by 1000 "
"DASH. Those DASH remain under the sole control of their owner at all times, "
"and can still be freely spent. The funds are not locked in any way. However,"
" if the funds are moved or spent, the associated masternode will go offline "
"and stop receiving rewards."
msgstr ""
"Em suma, os mineradores tem poder a primeira camada, que é o básico de envio"
" e o recebimento de fundos e prevenção de doublespending. Masternodes tem "
"poder da segunda camada, que fornecem os recursos adicionais que tornam a "
"Dash diferente de outros criptomoedas. E computadores de mineração não podem"
" servir como masternodes. Além disso, cada masternode é \"protegido\" por "
"1000 DASH. Essas DASH permaneçam sob o controle exclusivo de seu "
"proprietário em todos os momentos e ainda pode ser gasto livremente. Os "
"fundos não são bloqueados de forma alguma. No entanto, se os fundos são "
"movidos ou gasto, o dono do masternode vai ficar off-line e parar de receber"
" recompensas."
