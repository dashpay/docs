"Mining Dash in pools is more likely to generate rewards than solo mining "
"directly on the blockchain. This is because you are extremely unlikely to "
"mine a block as an individual given the current mining difficulty, so "
"pooling efforts results in more frequent incremental rewards than extremely "
"rare large rewards. Commercial mining pools offer a number of services, "
"described below using the example of Luxor Mining."

"Some miners may decide to host the machines directly in their homes. This "
"can work if you have a good shed or basement. But keep in mind that ASIC "
"machines can be intrusive in your home. They are quite loud when operating "
"(think a vacuum cleaner). In addition, mining hardware consumes a very "
"significant amount of electricity, so running multiple mining ASICs in your "
"home may damage your wiring or fuse board, may require additional "
"ventilation or power and network distribution systems, and bears a risk of "
"starting a fire. Ensure you are properly informed about these challenges "
"before mining at home."

"Depending on the above considerations and your electricity rate, it may make"
" sense to send your mining machine to a mining colocation site for hosting "
"on your behalf. The mining colocation business takes a \"hosting fee\" in "
"return for setup, ensuring proper operations, electricity and ongoing "
"maintenance."
