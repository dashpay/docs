"Dash wallets function by securely storing the private keys used to create "
"transactions using publicly visible addresses on a distributed ledger called"
" a blockchain. In some cases, it may be necessary to verify an address to "
"demonstrate control of the funds that it holds, that you can receive using "
"the address, or even to verify your identity to an exchange that has "
"previously seen a transaction from that address. To avoid phishing attacks, "
"take great care when sending signed messages to parties you do not trust, "
"since ambiguously worded messages could be used to impersonate your "
"identity."

"Signing messages requires a private key. Verifying messages requires a "
"public address. In this way, you can write an arbitrary message and generate"
" a signature that could only have been created by a user with control of the"
" private key for this address. Any user with the message, the public address"
" and the signature can easily verify that only you could have created the "
"signature. Messages are not stored on the blockchain. Instead, you must send"
" these three text snippets (message, address and signature) to your intended"
" recipient using another communication channel, such as email. As an "
"example, you can test the following message and signature and verify that it"
" was signed by the given address::"
