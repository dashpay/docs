"Dash Core Wallet is the full official release of Dash, and supports all Dash"
" features as they are released, including InstantSend and CoinJoin, as well "
"as an RPC console and governance features. Dash Core Wallet (sometimes known"
" as the QT wallet, due to the QT software framework used in development) is "
"a professional or heavy wallet which downloads the full blockchain (several "
"GB in size) and can operate as both a full node or masternode on the "
"network. Because of the requirement to hold a full copy of the blockchain, "
"some time is required for synchronisation when starting the wallet. Once "
"this is done, the correct balances will be displayed and the functions in "
"the wallet can be used. Dash Core Wallet is available for macOS, Linux, "
"Raspberry Pi and Windows."
