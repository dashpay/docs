"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash's attempt to solve "
"two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance"
" in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no"
" central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such "
"decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. "
"The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once (yes/no/abstain) for "
"each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be implemented (or not) by "
"Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash's Core Team "
"submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be "
"increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve "
"this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been"
" raging for nearly three years and has resulted in serious splits within the"
" community and even forks to the Bitcoin blockchain."

"基于区块链的去中心化管理，或称DGBB，是达世币的一个创新尝试，即解决加密数字货币中的两个重要问题：管理和资金。在去中心化的项目中，实现管理很困难，因为从定义上讲没有中央集权去为项目做决定。在达世币中，这种决定通过网络来实现，即由主节点持有者来决定。DGBB系统允许每一个主节点对每一个提案投一次票（同意/不同意/弃权）。如果提案通过，它可以被达世币的开发者执行（或者不执行）。一个重要的例子就是2016年初，当达世币核心团队向网络递交一个提案，询问区块的大小是否应该提高到2MB时，在24小时内批准此变更的共识便已经达成。与之相比，比特币关于区块大小的争论已经激烈进行了将近三年。"

"The DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While "
"other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses"
" 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is "
"mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and "
"the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the "
"month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal "
"earns the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at "
"the end of the month the requested amount will be paid out in a "
"\"superblock\". At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% "
"of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus "
"funds itself by reserving 10% of the block reward for budget projects."

"DGBB还为达世币提供了促进自身发展的资金。当其它加密数字货币项目还需要依赖捐赠或赞助来维持发展时，达世币已经通过划拨10%的区块奖励实现了发展资金的自给自足。在开挖每一个新区块的奖励中，45%将被分配给矿工、45%被分配给主节点持有人，剩下的10%则被预留作为下个月的预算资金。在月度预算周期内，任何人都可以向网络发起预算提案。如果提案获得10%甚至更多的主节点持有人的赞成，那么，超级块将提供提案所申请的资金。届时，预留的区块奖励（即每个区块奖励的10%）将被用作提案的赞助资金。换言之，达世币网络通过这10%的区块奖励保证了发展资金的自给自足。"
