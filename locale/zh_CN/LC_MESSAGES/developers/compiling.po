"While Dash offers stable binary builds on the `website "
"<https://www.dash.org/downloads/>`_ and on `GitHub "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/releases>`_, and development builds using "
"`GitLab CI <https://gitlab.com/dashpay/dash/pipelines>`_,  many users will "
"also be interested in building Dash binaries for themselves. This process "
"has been greatly simplified with the release of Dash Core 0.13.0, and users "
"who do not required deterministic builds can typically follow the `generic "
"build notes <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/develop/doc/build-"

"Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Dash "
"Core executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the "
"executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes sure "
"that the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the "
"executable. Multiple developers build the source code by following a "
"specific descriptor (\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and "
"upload the resulting signature. These results are compared and only if they "
"match, the build is accepted and uploaded to dash.org."

"Gitian属于确定性构建过程，用于构建Dash "
"Core的可执行文件。Gitian提供有一种方法，可合理地确认可执行文件真实构建自GitHub上的源文件。Gitian还可确保将相同的、经过测试的依赖项应用于可执行文件，并将其静态构建到可执行文件中。多名开发者依照特定的描述符（\"recipe\"）来构建源代码，加密签署结果，并将生成的签名上传。对这些结果进行比较，如果相匹配，则接受构建并上传至dash.org。"
