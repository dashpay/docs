"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "
"decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant "
"fraction of the masternodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with "
"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 1000 Dash. The "
"coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need to be kept in a "
"certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves or"
" spends those coins, the masternode stops working and payment ceases."

"任何个人都可以运行达世币主节点。主节点的目标是提高去中心化程度，从而避免某个人或某一群体掌控大量的主节点。不过，为了防范不必要的主节点或莽撞的持有人，达世币网络要求个人存入1000个达世币用以证明资格，能够持有一个主节点。这笔资金不必绑定在主节点上，但是必须存在达世币网络上并向整个网络公开。一旦持有人将资金提现或支出，主节点将停止运行而关联的区块奖励也将停止支付。"

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the PrivateSend, InstantSend and "

"reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners. "
"Masternodes are selected for payment in each block (approximately every 2.6 "
"minutes) from a deterministic masternode list, and moved to the back of the "
"list after payment. As more masternodes are created, the duration between "
"payments increases. If the collateral behind a masternode is spent, or if a "
