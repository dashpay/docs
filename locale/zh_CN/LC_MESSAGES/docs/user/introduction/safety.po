"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"in comparison with the traditional banking system is that transactions occur"
" **directly between two parties without any central authority** to "
"facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you are responsible for "
"your own security** - there is no bank or credit card company to reverse a "
"transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. If you forget or lose your "
"wallet file, recovery phrase or PIN, you will permanently and irrevocably "
"lose access to your funds."

"对于不熟悉加密数字货币的个人来说，它们与传统银行系统相比最重大的变化就是它们的 **交易直接发生在交易的双方之间，不需要任何权威机构来促成交易** "

"——如果用户的个人资金被盗或丢失，没有银行或信用卡公司能撤销交易；如果用户忘记或丢失钱包文件、恢复词条或个人识别码，那么他们将永远失去对个人资金的访问权限。"
