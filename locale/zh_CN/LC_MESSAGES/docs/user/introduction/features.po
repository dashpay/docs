"The release of Dash 0.12.2.0 and activation of DIP0001 saw a simultaneous"
" reduction of fees by a factor of 10, while the block size was increased "
"from 1MB to 2MB to promote continued growth of low-cost transactions even"
" as the cost of Dash rises. Dash 0.13.0.0 introduced InstantSend "
"autolocks, which caused masternodes to automatically attempt to lock any "
"transaction with 4 or fewer inputs — which are referred to as “simple” "
"transactions — and removed the additional fee for InstantSend. 0.14.0.0 "
"then removed the limitation on 4 inputs, so the network will attempt to "

":ref:`CoinJoin` works by creating denominations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and "
"0.001 DASH and then creating CoinJoin transactions with other users using"
" these denominations. Creation of the denominations is charged at the "
"default fee for a standard transaction. Using CoinJoin is free, but to "
"prevent spam attacks, an average of one in ten CoinJoin transactions are "
"charged a fee of 0.0001 DASH. Spending denominated inputs using CoinJoin "
"incurs the usual standard fees, but to avoid creating a potentially "
"identifiable change address, the fee is always rounded up to the lowest "
"possible denomination. This is typically 0.001 DASH, so it is important "
"to deduct the fee from the amount being sent if possible to minimise "
"fees. Combining InstantSend and CoinJoin may be expensive due to this "
"requirement and the fact that a CoinJoin transaction may require several "
"inputs, while InstantSend charges a fee of 0.0001 DASH per input. Always "
"check your fees before sending a transaction."
