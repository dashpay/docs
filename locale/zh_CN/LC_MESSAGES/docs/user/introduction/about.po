"Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused "
"cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features :ref:`instant "
"transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, optional "
":ref:`privacy <coinjoin>` equal to that of physical cash, a :ref:`self-"
"governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` driven by "
":ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a `clear roadmap "
"<https://www.dash.org/roadmap/>`_ for on-chain scaling to up to 400MB blocks"
" using custom-developed open source hardware. While Dash is based on Bitcoin"
" and compatible with many key components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-"
"tier network structure offers significant improvements in transaction speed,"
" privacy and governance. This section of the documentation describes these "
"and many more key features that set Dash apart in the blockchain economy."
