"Dash is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus on "
"the payments industry. Dash offers a form of money that is portable, "
"inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and in"
" person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin project, "
"Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments system in the "
"world. In addition to Bitcoin's feature set, Dash currently also offers "
"instant transactions (:ref:`instantsend`), private transactions "
"(:ref:`coinjoin`) and operates a self-governing and self-funding model that "
"enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses for work that "
"adds value to the network. This :ref:`decentralized governance and budgeting"
" system <governance>` makes it one of the first ever successful "
"decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)."

"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"is that transactions occur directly between two parties without any central "
"authority to facilitate the transaction. This also means that you are "
"responsible for your own security - there is no bank or credit card company "
"to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. In this sense, it"
" is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency can be spent locally and "
"internationally with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds "
"to the right destination. For these reasons, the Dash documentation has a "
"strong focus on safety and understanding the concepts and features that "
"drive the Dash ecosystem. The videos, links and documentation below can help"
" you get started, or use the table of contents on the left to find a "
"specific topic of interest."

"如果你对加密数字货币的认识还刚刚起步，相较于传统货币你需要理解的最重要的变化就是在交易双方之间没有任何权力中心来控制交易。同时这也意味着你要对自己的交易安全负责，如果你的资金被盗或丢失，没有银行或者信用卡公司作为中间环节能帮你撤回交易。从这点来说，它更像现金和金子，不过加密数字货币在全球各地和本地的使用一样容易，当然前提是你要确保收款方地址是正确的。基于这些原因，达世币的文件资料更多地着眼于安全，以及对推动达世币生态系统的理念和特性的理解上。以下的视频，链接和文件可以帮助你开始，或使用左侧的目录来选择你感兴趣的话题。"
