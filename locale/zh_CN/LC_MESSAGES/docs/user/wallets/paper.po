"A paper wallet is a method of storing a private key to access funds stored "
"on a single address. It can be generated on a computer that has never been "
"connected to the internet, and printed out for air-gapped offline storage. "
"As such, they are suitable for storing large amounts of Dash, but care must "
"be taken not to lose the private key, since there is no way of recovering "
"funds if it is ever lost. To use the key, it must be imported or \"swept\" "
"into an online wallet and should not be used again. Paper wallets are "
"extremely secure but somewhat inconvenient for everyday use compared to "
"hardware wallets, which also offer a high degree of security."
