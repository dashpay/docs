"This documentation describes how to safely back up your wallet file for "
"safe storage in case your computer or laptop is damaged or lost. Dash "
"Core stores all data necessary to control your Dash addresses in a single"
" file called *wallet.dat*. This wallet is in the Berkeley DB format and "
"stores the pairs of private/public cryptographic keys used to manage your"
" balances on the Dash blockchain. For HD wallets, the mnemonic, "
"passphrase, and seed are also stored in *wallet.dat*. Dash Core makes "
"most of these operations transparent and even generates automatic backups"
" of your wallet file in case it is corrupted, but the user is responsible"
" for ensuring that these backups are stored in a safe place. **If you "
"lose access to your wallet file, you will permanently lose access to your"
" Dash.**"

"本文档将指导用户在台式电脑或笔记本电脑发生故障或丢失的时候安全地备份和还原Dash Core钱包。Dash "
"Core钱包存储着管理达世币地址的所有数据，这些数据都存储在一个名叫\\ *wallet.dat*\\ 的文件当中。这个钱包以Berkeley "
"DB嵌入式数据库编程库为格式，它存储着用于管理达世币区块链余额的公钥和私钥配对。Dash "
"Core钱包的大多数操作都是公开透明的，而且能在钱包受损的时候自动备份钱包文件。不过，用户有责任确保备份得到妥善的保管。\\ "
