"Web wallets are services which keep a Dash balance for you, while "
"maintaining control of the private keys on your behalf. Any Dash stored on "
":ref:`exchanges <exchanges>` falls under this category, but there are also "
"some services able to store Dash for you through simple Google/Facebook "
"login systems. Be extremely careful with web storage, as your Dash is only "
"as secure as the reputation of the company storing it for you. A particular "
"exception is MyDashWallet.org, which provides a secure web interface to the "
"Dash blockchain while leaving you with full control of your private keys."

"网页钱包可为你保存达世币资金，同时替你来保管私钥，任何存在\\ :ref:`交易平台 <exchanges>`\\ "
"上的达世币都属于这一类。除此之外还有其它一些服务仅通过简单的Google/Facebook登录，也能让你存放达世币。要特别小心这些网页存储，达世币在这里的安全性只能靠这些公司的声誉来保证。MyDashWallet.org是个特例，它提供了一个达世币区块链的安全网页接口，让你自己全权掌控你的密钥。"
