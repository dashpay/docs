"A hardware wallet is a type of device which stores private keys for a "
"blockchain in a secure hardware device, instead of in a database file such "
"as wallet.dat used with common software wallets. This offers major security "
"advantages over software wallets, as well as practical benefits over paper "
"wallets. To date, there is no verifiable evidence of hardware wallets being "
"compromised by viruses, and they are also immune to keylogger attacks that "
"could be used to steal passwords to unlock the private keys used with "
"software wallets."

"硬件钱包是一种可以存储区域链密钥的安全的硬件设备，而不是像普通软件钱包那样的wallet.dat数据库文件。它具有比软件钱包更优的安全性，和对比纸钱包的实用价值。迄今为止，还没有确切的证据显示硬件钱包会被病毒破解，另外，它对键盘记录攻击也是免疫的，防止有人利用此方法盗取密码来破译软件钱包的私钥。"

"Hardware wallets function by storing your private keys in a protected area "
"of a microcontroller. It is impossible for the private key to leave the "
"device in plain text - only the signed output of the cryptographic hash is "
"ever transmitted to the device interacting with the blockchain, such as your"
" computer or smartphone. Most hardware wallets feature a screen which allows"
" you to independently confirm the address you are sending to is correct."
msgstr ""
"硬件钱包会把你的私钥存放在微型处理器的一个受保护区域。它不会让你的私钥以简单字符的方式离开设备，只有加密哈希的签名输出会被发送到与区块链相连的设备，如你的计算机或智能手机上。多数的硬件钱包都带有一个屏幕，使你能各自地确认发出地址是否正确。"
