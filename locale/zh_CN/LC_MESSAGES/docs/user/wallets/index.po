"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is necessary."
" This applies to barter systems as well as economies using currency as a "
"medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a private ledger, "
"cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses on a distributed "
"public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access the balance stored "
"on each public address are therefore the object of value in this system. "
"This section of the documentation discusses different practical methods of "
"keeping these keys safe in wallets, while still remaining useful for day-to-"
"day needs."

"任何时候你存储一个有价值的东西，安全都是必须的。这适用于以物换物的交易，也适用于以货币作为媒介的经济行为。银行把钱存放在私人账户下，加密货款将钱存放在分布式公共账户的唯一地址下。于是用于进入公共地址存款的私钥便成了加密货币系统里的价值主体。这一部分的文件讨论了不同的实际方法，如何即保证密钥在钱包中的安全，同时还要满足每天使用的要求。"
