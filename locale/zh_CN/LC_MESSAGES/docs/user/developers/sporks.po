"A multi-phased fork, colloquially known as a \"spork\", is a mechanism "
"unique to Dash used to safely deploy new features to the network through "
"network-level variables to avoid the risk of unintended network forking "
"during upgrades. It can also be used to disable certain features if a "
"security vulnerability is discovered - see the :ref:`features page <sporks>`"
" for a brief introduction to sporks."

"Enforcement of spork-controlled code can be activated remotely by members of"
" the core development team signing a network message using a relevant "
"private key. Should problems arise, the code can be deactivated in the same "
"manner, without the need for a network-wide rollback or client update. This "
"documentation describes the meaning of each spork currently existing on the "
"network, and how to check their respective statuses."
