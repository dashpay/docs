"Dash is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on user-friendly"
" payments and transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these "
"features are implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known as "
"masternodes, which gives rise to many exciting features not available on "
"conventional blockchains. These features include instant and private "
"transactions, as well as governance of the development of the Dash network "
"through a monthly budget and voting. This in itself is a first in the crypto"
" world, and the masternodes are necessary to achieve the privacy and speed "
"that Dash offers."

"This documentation focuses on understanding the services masternodes provide"
" to the network, but also includes guides on how to run a masternode, using "
"either a hosting provider or by setting up and maintaining your own hosting "
"solution. The primary requirement to run a masternode on the Dash network is"
" 1000 DASH. This is known as the collateral, and cannot be spent without "
"interrupting operation of the masternode. The second requirement is the "
"actual server running the Dash masternode software."

"本文档不仅侧重介绍主节点为网络提供的服务，还提供主节点的运营指导，其中包括借助托管服务商或创立个人托管方案。持有并运营主节点的第一个要求是用户必须存入1000个达世币作为保证金。一旦用户支出这笔资金，那么主节点的运营将会停止。除了满足保证金的要求之外，用户还需要运行达世币主节点软件的实际服务器。"

"Since operating your own server requires a certain level knowledge of "
"blockchains and Linux server operating systems, several community members "
"offer dedicated hosting solutions for a fee. Taking advantage of these "
"services means the user only needs to provide the masternode collateral and "
"pay the hosting fee in order to receive payment from the block reward. See "
":ref:`these pages <masternode-hosting>` for information on how to set up a "
"hosted masternode."
msgstr ""
"运行个人服务器要求用户对区块链和Linux操作系统有一定的了解。考虑到不是每位用户都具备这样的知识积累，一些社区成员面向用户提供了有偿的托管服务。换言之，借助托管服务的用户只需存入主节点保证金并缴纳托管服务费就能获取区块奖励了。如需了解主节点托管设置的相关知识，请参考\\"

"Users with a deeper understanding (or curiosity) about the inner workings of"
" the Dash network may choose to operate their own masternode on their own "
"host server. Several steps are required, and the user must assume "
"responsibility for setting up, securing and maintaining both the server and "
"collateral. See these pages for information on how to set up a self-operated"
" masternode."
msgstr ""
"对达世币网络的运行原理有着深入了解（或好奇）的用户可以在个人托管服务器上自行运营主节点。这要求用户采取多个步骤，并承担架设、安全防护和维护服务器及保证金的责任。如需了解创建自行运营的主节点的相关知识，请参考这些页面。"
