"Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition "
"there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash,"
" such decisions are made by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or DAO)"
" consisting of the masternodes. The DAO allows each masternode to vote once "
"(yes/no/abstain) for each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be "
"implemented (or not) by Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016, "
"when Dash's Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the"
" blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been "
"reached to approve this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the"
" blocksize has been raging for nearly three years and has resulted in "
"serious splits within the community and even forks to the Bitcoin "
"blockchain."

"The DAO also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While "
"other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses"
" 20% of the block subsidy to fund its own development. Every time a block is"
" mined, 80% of the subsidy is split between the miner and a masternode per "
"the distribution found :ref:`here <block-reward-reallocation>`, while the "
"remaining 20% is not created until the end of the month. During the month, "
"anybody can make a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal earns "
"the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the end "
"of the month the requested amount will be paid out in a \"superblock\". At "
"that time, the block subsidies that were not paid out (20% of each block) "
"will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus funds itself by "
"reserving 20% of the block subsidy for budget projects."
