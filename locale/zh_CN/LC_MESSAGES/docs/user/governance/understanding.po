"One of the greatest challenges of building a cryptocurrency platform is "
"ensuring you create a decentralized system of governance to manage, fund, "
"maintain and expand the project. This key element has been absent in every "
"major currency to date, so the natural response is to create a not-for-"
"profit foundation that is tasked with maintaining the core protocol and "
"promoting the coin, but is not really connected to the coin holders in any "
"meaningful way. This approach has a few issues that have been made evident "
"from the experience of older crypto currency platforms."
msgstr ""
"构建加密数字货币平台的最大挑战之一是确保您创建一个去中心化的管理系统来管理、资助、维护和扩展项目。到目前为止，这个关键元素在每一种主要货币中都没有出现，因此自然的反应是创建一个非盈利的基金会，负责维持核心协议和推广数字货币，但实际上该基金会并没有以任何有意义的方式与币的持有者建立联系。这种方法有几个问题，这些问题从较老的加密货币平台的经验中可以看出。"

"Current crypto foundations are not related to the currency itself by any "
"mechanism that is included in the protocol and are not designed to outlive "
"early adopters when they lose interest. The foundation then struggles to "
"maintain funding until it implodes and core development of the protocol is "
"left scrambling for funding or depending on charity that can’t be counted on"
" and does not allow for proper budgeting and planning. Donations are also "
"unfair to donors because there are always free riders that benefit from the "
"effort done by others without contributing. Other projects have financed "
"themselves by premining coins or running prelaunch sales, which is not a "
"great solution either because control of the funds is centralized and at "
"that stage it is impossible to quantify the future needs of the project."

"目前的加密数字货币基金会与货币本身并没有任何被包含在协议内的机制的关联，并且在使用者失去兴趣时，他们的寿命也不会超过早期的使用者。然后该基金会努力维持资金，直到它内部崩溃且协议的核心发展被抛在一边以争夺资金，或者依赖于不被指望的慈善机构，基金会不允许有适当的预算和规划。捐款对捐助者也是不公平的，因为总会有免费搭便车者在不捐款的情况下从他人的努力中受益。其他项目的资金来源是预挖的币或进行预发行销售，这也不是一个很好的解决办法，因为资金的控制是集中的，而且在那个阶段不可能量化项目的未来需求。"
