"analogy, a masternode operator should also treat as regular income the fair "

"正如大家所知，主节点运营者为达世币网络提供交易验证服务，而区块奖励正是支付给他们的报酬。美国税务当局明确规定，“如果税务人成功地参与‘挖矿’活动并获得加密数字货币，那么加密数字货币在收到之日前的公平市价都应包含在个人总收入当中。”可以确定的是，主节点不属于“挖矿”活动，不过，税务当局仍然考虑通过计算机资源来验证比特币交易并将比特币交易的公共帐目组成“挖矿”活动。类比之下，主节点运营者应将区块链奖励的公平市价视作是常规收入的一部分。"

"A Dash user may demonstrate to the network his or her control over 1,000 "
"DASH in order to run a masternode. These tokens never leave the user’s "
"control. If at any point during the user’s tenure as a masternode operator, "
"the user disposes of any or all of the 1,000 DASH, the network automatically"
" strips the user of his or her status as a masternode. Under the US Internal"
" Revenue Code, gain or loss is realized only on the “sale or exchange” of "
"property. The term “sale” generally means the transfer of all right, title, "
"and interest in the property transferred. A number of factors typically are "
"considered to determine whether a sale has occurred, the most important "
"being whether the benefits and burdens of ownership of the transferred "
"property have passed from the transferor to the transferee. In Dash, the "
"masternode operator retains control of the 1,000 DASH and simply "
"demonstrates that control to the network. Therefore, the holding of the "
"1,000 DASH for purposes of qualifying as a masternode operator should not "
"cause a taxable event to occur because the user has not transferred any of "
"the benefits and burdens of ownership."

"用户需要向达世币网络证明个人在账户上存有1,000个达世币的保证金，这样才能运行主节点。这些资金不会脱离个人的管控。一旦主节点持有人支付1,000个达世币保证金中的一部分或全部，那么网络将自动结束个人作为主节点持有人的状态。根据美国《国内税收法》的规定，个人只有在出售或交换财产的时候才会发生损益。出售一词通常指转让的财产的权利、所有权和权益。在界定出售行为是否发生时需要考虑多种因素，其中最重要的就是转移财产所有权的关联利益与负担是否已经从转让人转移给了受让人。以达世币为例，主节点运营者全权掌控1,000个达世币的保证金，这样才能证明个人在达世币网络上的权益。因此，主节点1,000个达世币的保证金是证明主节点运营者持有主节点的证据，它没有伴随利益与负担的转移，因此这笔保证金不应成为纳税的缘由。"

"Assuming that the 1,000 DASH are sold, whether that Dash is a “capital "

"Inventory, depreciable property, and stock in trade, though, are not. "
"Assuming the masternode operator held the 1,000 DASH either for investment "
"purposes or for purposes of qualifying as a masternode operator, the IRS "
"would likely treat gain or loss on the sale of those Dash tokens as capital "
"in nature. Therefore, Dash held for a long enough period of time could be "
"subject to the lower “long term capital gains” tax rate."
msgstr ""
"假设持有人售出1,000个达世币，那么达世币是否属于资本资产将决定了销售收入的税收处理。举个例子，股票、债券和其它投资资产都被视作资本资产，而储备、可折旧资产和贸易存量则不是资本资产。假如主节点运营者持有1,000个达世币保证金的目的是为了获取投资回报或获得主节点所有权，那么美国税务当局可能将出售保证金带来的损益定性为资本资产。因此，长时间持有的达世币可能会受到较低的“长期资本收益”税率的影响。"

"Almost all crimes require that a defendant have a defined *mens rea* at the "

" commonly understood as desiring as your “conscious object” the result of a "

"在为交易提供中继服务的时候，大多数主节点都是没有自主意识的，相关用户的身份、用户资金的最终去向、或有关达世币交易的情况都是匿名的。因此，检察官难以证明主节点持有人在为非法交易提供中继服务时是带有*犯罪意图*的。"

"we are sometimes asked whether masternode operators, by their involvement in"
" relaying Dash transactions, could be “aiding and abetting” or “conspiring” "
"to commit a crime that might involve Dash. Generally speaking, aiding and "
"abetting requires that the defendant (i) seek by his action to make the "
"crime succeed and (ii) act with the same *mens rea* as required for the "
"principal offense."
msgstr ""
"即使不是犯罪活动的主要参与者，个人也可能因为参与犯罪而需要承担次要责任。因此，达世币团队也曾被问到，主节点运营者是否要为中继达世币交易并“帮助和教唆”或“密谋”犯罪而承担责任。通常来说，协助和教唆意味着被告：（i）通过个人行为促使罪行成功；（ii）出于与主要责任人一样的犯罪意图而犯下罪行。"

"No matter the requisite *mens rea* of a particular principal offense "

"without more, could be found to have “aided and abetted.\" To be sure, the "
"masternodes do provide assistance in the principal offense – in that "
"masternode action is required to process all Dash transactions. However, the"
" masternodes would not have the requisite *mens rea* to satisfy the "
"requirements of aiding and abetting liability. Masternode operators have no "
"readily available information about the purpose or consequences of users’ "
"Dash transactions, or even the originating identity of the sender of funds. "
"As such, so long as a sufficient diversity of non-criminal transactions "
"occur on the Dash network, they would not harbor even the least culpable "
"*mens rea* (i.e. negligence) with respect to a user relaying or receiving "
"Dash in furtherance of a particular crime."
msgstr ""
"无论达世币用户犯下既定罪行的必要条件是什么，主节点持有人不太可能会“帮助和教唆”犯罪。可以肯定的是，达世币可能会为主犯提供协助，因为主节点的行动是需要处理所有的达世币交易。然而，主节点不具备犯罪的必要条件，即*犯罪意图*，因此不满足“帮助和教唆”犯罪的要求。主节点运营者并不了解用户交易的目的或后果，也不了解发款方的初始身份。因此，只要达世币网络上存在足够的、大量的非犯罪交易，主节点持有人就不具备犯罪意图（例如疏忽等等），也就不满足为既定犯罪活动提供中继或接受服务的条件。"
