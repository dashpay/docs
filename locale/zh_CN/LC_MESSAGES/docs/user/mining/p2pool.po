"This guide describes how to set up a Dash P2Pool node to manage a pool of "
"miners. Unlike centralized mining pools, P2Pool is based on the same "
"peer-2-peer (P2P) model as Dash, making the pool as a whole highly resistant"
" to malicious attacks, and preserving and protecting the decentralized "
"nature of Dash. When you launch a P2Pool node, it seeks out, connects with, "
"and shares data with a decentralized network of other P2Pool nodes (also "
"known as peers). P2Pool nodes share a cryptographic chain of data "
"representing value, similar to Dash's blockchain. The P2Pool version is "
"called the sharechain. The decentralized and fair nature of this mining "
"model means mining with P2Pool is strongly encouraged. P2Pool for Dash uses "
"the `p2pool-dash <https://github.com/dashpay/p2pool-dash>`_ software on "
"GitHub, which is a fork of p2pool for Bitcoin. For more information, see "
"`here <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool>`__."

"本指南描述如何架设达世币P2Pool节点来管理矿池。与集中式矿池不同，P2Pool以与达世币相同的peer-2-peer（点对点）模式为基础，使矿池作为一个整体高度抵抗恶意攻击，并维持和保护达世币的去中心化性质。当您启动P2Pool节点时，它会与其他P2Pool节点（也被称为对等节点）的去中心化网络查找、连接和共享数据。P2Pool节点共享一个表示价值的加密数据链，类似于达世币的区块链。P2Pool版本被称为共享链。这种挖矿模式的去中心化和公平性意味着人们强烈鼓励使用P2Pool进行挖矿。达世币的P2Pool使用在GitHub上的\\"

"Because of the way P2Pool manages difficulty adjustments on the sharechain, "
"it is important to maintain low latency between the miners and the P2Pool "
"node to avoid miners submitting shares too late to enter the sharechain. "
"When setting up your node, you need to consider its physical and network "
"location relative to the miners you intend to connect to the node. If you "
"operate a mining farm, your P2Pool node should probably be a physical "
"machine on the same local network as your miners. If you plan to operate a "
"public node, it may be best to set up your P2Pool node as a virtual machine "
"in a data center with a high speed connection so geographically close miners"
" can mine to your pool with relatively low latency."
msgstr ""
"由于P2Pool在共享链上管理难度调整的方式，重要的是保持矿工和P2Pool节点之间的低延迟，以避免矿工提交算力太晚而无法进入共享链。在设置您的节点时，相对于您打算连接到该节点的矿工，您需要考虑其物理和网络位置。如果您经营一个矿场，您的P2Pool节点可能是与您的矿工相同的本地网络上的物理机器。如果您计划运营一个公共节点，最好将您的P2Pool节点设置为具有高速连接的数据中心的虚拟机，以便地理位置相近的矿工能够以相对较低的延迟挖到您的矿池。"
