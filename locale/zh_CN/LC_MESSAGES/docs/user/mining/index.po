"Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as Dash refers to the process "
"of searching for solutions to cryptographically difficult problems as a "
"method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of mining creates "
"new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. Mining is possible on a range "
"of hardware. Dash implements an algorithm known as :ref:`X11 <x11-hash-"
"algorithm>`, which the miner must solve in order to earn rewards. A number "
"of X11 ASICs are available on the market, which help make Dash secure "
"against brute force attacks on the blockchain."

"Dash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"Dash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners "
"attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when "
"they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the "
"blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the "
"problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the "
"miner is rewarded."
msgstr ""
"和比特币及其它加密数字货币一样，达世币以包含所有交易的分布式帐本为基础，这些帐本也称区块链。达世币和比特币区块链由于共识机制的存在得到了保障，这种共识机制被称作工作量证明（PoW）。矿工通过专用的设备来解决难题，在难题解决后，他们有权向区块链添加新的区块。如果运行软件的其他用户认为难题已经得到了恰当的解决，那么新的区块将会被添加到区块链上，而矿工也将得到区块奖励。"

"Dash works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a two-"
"tier network. The second tier is powered by :ref:`masternodes <masternodes>`"
" (Full Nodes), which enable financial privacy (CoinJoin), instant "
"transactions (InstantSend), and the decentralized governance and budget "
"system. Because this second tier is so important, masternodes are also "
"rewarded when miners discover new blocks. The breakdown is as follows: 80% "
"of the block subsidy is split between the miner and a masternode per the "
"distribution found :ref:`here <block-reward-reallocation>`, while 20% is "
"reserved for the budget system (created by superblocks every month)."

"The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the "
"masternodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the entire "
"network is overseen by the masternodes, which have the power to reject "
"improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire "
"block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the Dash "
"software, the masternode network would orphan that block, and it would not "
"be added to the blockchain."
msgstr ""
"主节点系统也称服务量证明（PoSe），因为主节点的实质正是为网络提供关键的服务。事实上，整个达世币网络都由主节点监督，它们有权驳回由矿工创建的不合格的区块。如果矿工尝试占有全部的区块奖励或运行旧版的达世币软件，那么主节点网络就会孤立该区块，使它无法添加到区块链上。"

"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. Masternodes power the "
"second tier, which provide the added features that make Dash different from "
"other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes do not mine, and mining computers cannot"
" serve as masternodes. Additionally, each masternode is “secured” by 1000 "
"DASH. Those DASH remain under the sole control of their owner at all times, "
"and can still be freely spent. The funds are not locked in any way. However,"
" if the funds are moved or spent, the associated masternode will go offline "
"and stop receiving rewards."
msgstr ""
"简而言之，矿工组成了网络的第一层级，为用户提供资金的发送和接收服务并防止双花支付的发生。主节点则构成了网络的第二层级，为达世币与众不同的性能提供支持。主节点不参与挖矿活动，因此挖矿的设备并不能充当主节点。要想持有主节点，用户必须持有1000达世币作为\"保证金\"。这笔保证金始终由持有人全权掌控，并且可以被持有人自由支配。换言之，保证金不会以任何方式予以锁定。不过，一旦保证金被转移或支付，对应的主节点将会下线并停止接收区块链奖励。"
