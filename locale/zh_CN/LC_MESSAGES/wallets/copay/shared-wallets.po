"Normal transactions in Dash only need to be approved by the person sending "
"the funds. The Dash Copay wallet supports multisig, short for "
"multisignature, meaning that it is possible to require more than one key to "
"approve a transaction. This can be used like a joint checking account, or in"
" situations where majority approval from a board is required to create a "
"transaction. This documentation describes how to set up and use shared "
"wallets."

"达世币的常规交易只需发款方授权即可。达世币Copay钱包则支持多重签名，即交易的达成需要多方授权。也就是说，多重签名与联名账户相似，又像董事会需取得多数赞成才能推行方案。本文档将向用户介绍共享钱包的创建和使用。"

"Before you create a shared wallet, think about how many people should have "
"access to it, and how many of those people will be required to authorise a "
"transaction. Is it just one or two? Or a majority, or even everyone? Shared "
"wallets allow you to specify a total number of copayers and a required "
"number of signatures to create a transaction. These are often referred to as"
" M-of-N transactions, where for example 2-of-3 signatures are required to "
"transact. In practice, this is used to share responsibility for the funds "
"between several people. It is not possible require a certain person, such as"
" the manager, to be one of the copayers (although adding a password only the"
" manager knows can have the same effect). Shared wallets are inherently "
"risky because if more than the minimum required number of people involved "
"lose access to their keys, the funds will be inaccessible forever. Make sure"
" everyone understands the risks and responsibilities of shared wallets "
"before committing significant funds."

"在创建共享钱包之前，用户应当考虑钱包的访问人数和交易所需的授权人数。访问人数是否只有一两个人？交易是否需要大多数共享用户甚至所有共享用户的签名授权？共享钱包允许用户指定共享用户的总人数N和创建交易所需的签名数量M，因此，共享钱包通常也被称作m/n交易。以2"
" "
"-3多重签名钱包为例，用户需要得到三方中的两方的签名授权才能完成交易。在实践中，多重签名钱包可帮助多名用户共同承担责任。不过，用户无法要求管理者等具体人员担当共享用户（虽然新增只有管理者知悉的密码也会导致相同的结果）。共享钱包也有其固有风险——如果因私钥丢失而无法访问钱包的用户超过了交易所需的授权人数，"
" 那么钱包里的资金就永远都无法启用了。总而言之，在存入大笔款项之前，用户需要确保所有人都充分理解共享钱包的风险和责任。"

"**创建m/n多重签名钱包** 来完成创建。此时，钱包将会与用户的其它钱包一起显示，但在其它共享用户加入之前，这个钱包将显示为 **未完成** 。"
