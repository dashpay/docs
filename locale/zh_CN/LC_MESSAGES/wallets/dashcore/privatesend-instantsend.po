"This documentation describes how to use Dash Core to send Dash anonymously. "
"PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in RC4 of the DarkCoin client and "
"rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of running a "
"sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an external "
"observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a PrivateSend "
"transaction is created. This gives your Dash the same anonymous properties "
"as cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The mixing and denomination "
"process is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part of "
"the user. The current implementation of PrivateSend in the Dash Core wallet "
"allows any amount of Dash to be mixed for later use in PrivateSend "
"transactions. As of April 2018, PrivateSend is not currently available in "
"other Dash wallets."
msgstr ""
"本文档介绍了如何使用Dash Core钱包来匿名发送达世币。匿名发送功能始创于Darkcoin "
"RC4客户端，最初被称作Darksend。随后，这个功能在2016年5月被重新命名为匿名发送。它无需信任第三方就能完成一系列的交易操作（这一环节通常也被称作混币）。混币期间，外部的服务器无法确定匿名发送功能所涉资金的来源。匿名发送功能赋予了用户在ATM取现一样的匿名属性。混币和面值的处理过程是自动完成、无缝对接的，以用户的角度来看，他们不会受到任何干扰。Dash"
" "
"Core钱包当前的匿名发送功能可以帮助用户混合任意金额的达世币，以便之后匿名发送的使用。截至2018年4月，匿名发送功能还没有推广到其它版本的达世币钱包。"
