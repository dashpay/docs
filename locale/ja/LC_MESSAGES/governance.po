"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash's attempt to solve "
"two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance"
" in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no"
" central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such "
"decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. "
"The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once (yes/no/abstain) for "
"each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be implemented (or not) by "
"Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash's Core Team "
"submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be "
"increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve "
"this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been"
" raging for nearly three years and has resulted in serious splits within the"
" community and even forks to the Bitcoin blockchain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:22
msgid ""
"The DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While "
"other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses"
" 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is "
"mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and "
"the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the "
"month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal "
"earns the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at "
"the end of the month the requested amount will be paid out in a "
"\"superblock\". At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% "
"of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus "
"funds itself by reserving 10% of the block reward for budget projects."

"One of the greatest challenges of building a cryptocurrency platform is "
"ensuring you create a decentralized system of governance to manage, fund, "
"maintain and expand the project. This key element has been absent in every "
"major currency to date, so the natural response is to create a not-for-"
"profit foundation that is tasked with maintaining the core protocol and "
"promoting the coin, but is not really connected to the coin holders in any "
"meaningful way. This approach has a few issues that have been made evident "
"from the experience of older crypto currency platforms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:59
msgid ""
"Current crypto foundations are not related to the currency itself by any "
"mechanism that is included in the protocol and are not designed to outlive "
"early adopters when they lose interest. The foundation then struggles to "
"maintain funding until it implodes and core development of the protocol is "
"left scrambling for funding or depending on charity that can’t be counted on"
" and does not allow for proper budgeting and planning. Donations are also "
"unfair to donors because there are always free riders that benefit from the "
"effort done by others without contributing. Other projects have financed "
"themselves by premining coins or running prelaunch sales, which is not a "
"great solution either because control of the funds is centralized and at "
"that stage it is impossible to quantify the future needs of the project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:72
msgid ""
"Through the network of full nodes and the collateral requirement, Dash "
"already has a decentralized network of masternode operators that are heavily"
" invested in the future of the currency, and that as a group can act as "
"stewards of the core protocol development and promotion. We propose a "
"decentralized management system based on the masternode voting mechanism. "
"Masternode operators are not the only ones interested in the success of "
"Dash, but they are the most stable ones because, unlike miners, they can’t "
"reuse their asset for any other purpose or coin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:81
msgid ""
"In the budget system, a portion of the block reward is held in escrow by the"
" network itself, in the name of the operators, to be executed in the "
"development and expansion of the ecosystem according to the vote of the "
"masternodes in different budget proposals. These funds are directed to "
"supporting development and promotion of the coin. Masternode operators vote "
"on specific budgets and projects to be funded, thus defining the direction "
"the coin is taking. This is done in a completely transparent way through a "
"public portal where new initiatives are proposed and masternodes can vote on"
" them. Functioning like a decentralized Kickstarter or Lighthouse, the "
"budget can be used for anything that creates value within the ecosystem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:93
msgid ""
"This is a 100% decentralized system powered by the masternodes, where "
"budgets are set and paid directly from the blockchain. The blockchain hires "
"core developers in this way and introduces a new concept of paid blockchain "
"contractors, where people work for and are directly compensated by the "
"network, through the decentralized votes of all masternode operators. One "
"advantage of this model is it can survive early adopters. If early "
"masternode operators sell their coins, the new owner can set up a masternode"
" and with it acquire the right to vote on the budgets and projects. This "
"guarantees there is a working system of maintenance as people come and go, "
"making the network capable of sustaining itself on its own without depending"
" on specific actors."

"The system works as a decentralized voting mechanism set up in the rules "
"governing the blockchain, where budgets for specific projects are proposed, "
"then the masternodes as a whole vote on them. Each project, if it passes, is"
" added to the total budget and paid directly from the blockchain to the "
"person doing the work. This allows Dash to hire core developers and pay them"
" directly after approval of the work in a decentralized fashion."

"A masternode votes on a proposal (technically a governance object on the "
"blockchain) using the example command “masternode vote yes”, “masternode "
"vote no” or “masternode vote abstain”. The votes then propagate across the "
"network, and are tallied according to instructions followed by the network "
"itself. Budgets under discussion and voting progress can be viewed using the"
" example command “masternode budget show”."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:123
msgid ""
"A well defined decentralized system of governance allows a cryptocurrency "
"network to endure and survive its original creators. In this way, later "
"generations of masternode operators have a clear way to support the system "
"as defined by the protocol itself, applying wisdom of the crowd techniques "
"and the bond of trust established by the masternode collateral to create a "
"decentralized management system. This creates incredible value within the "
"currency, allowing us to be more agile and compete with other payment "
"systems, such as Bitcoin and credit cards, on a global scale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../governance.rst:133
msgid ""
"As the system has developed, a strong team of productive contractors paid "
"from blockchain rewards has arisen and become established. This includes the"
" core development team, escrow providers, news and reporting staff, "
"experimental development labs, partnerships with universities, hiring of "
"marketing and PR firms and integrations with third party exchanges and "
"payment platforms. The market recognizes the value of the stability of the "
"network as a whole, and that the possibility of reliable and sufficient "
"funding results in faster and more coherent implementation of the Dash "
"roadmap and core Dash services."

"and promotion, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits all actors, including"
" miners, masternode operators, investors and users. More importantly, this "

"chance of passing their proposal, it is created as a governance object on "
"the blockchain. A fee of 5 DASH is associated with this action to prevent "
"spam and ensure only serious proposals make it to this stage. Several tools "
"exist to allow masternode operators to comfortably review and vote on "
"propoals. The net total of yes votes must exceed 10% of the total masternode"
" count at the time votes are tallied in order to pass. If there are more "
"passing proposals than the available block reward can provide for, the "
"proposals with the most yes votes will pass first, creating a cut-off point "
"for less popular proposals. The same process is then repeated every month, "

"Due to the decentralized nature of the masternode system, it is sometimes "

"Every masternode operator establishes a bond of trust and a social contract "

"executed by the operators for the benefit of the ecosystem. Everyone "
"contributes equally and proportionately to the benefits they are receiving "
"and the risks they are taking, there are no privileges and no loopholes. "
"This is complemented by the full node voting mechanism that allows for a "
