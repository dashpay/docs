"Dash Electrum gathers configuration data when run for the first time. For "
"more on the concepts behind this process, skip to the later sections of this"
" guide discussing backups, security, and addresses. When setting up Dash "
"Electrum for the first time, a wizard will guide you through the process of "
"creating your first wallet. The first screen asks how you would like to "
"connect to the remote server. Select **Auto connect** and click **Next** to "
"continue. You will see a notice that no wallet currently exists. Enter a "
"name for your wallet (or accept the default name) and click **Next** to "
"create your wallet."

"You will be asked what kind of wallet you want to create. Choose between "
"**Standard wallet**, **Multi-signature wallet** and **Watch Dash "
"addresses**. If you are unsure, select **Standard wallet** and click "
"**Next** to continue. You will then be asked how you want to store/recover "
"the seed. If stored safely, a seed can be used to restore a lost wallet on "
"another computer. Choose between **Create a new seed**, **I already have a "
"seed**, **Use public or private keys** or **Use a hardware device**. If you "
"are using Electrum Dash for the first time and not restoring an existing "
"wallet, choose **Create a new seed** and click **Next** to continue."
