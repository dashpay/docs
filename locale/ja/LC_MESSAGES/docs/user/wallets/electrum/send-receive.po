"You may own Dash stored in another software wallet, or on an exchange such "
"as Bittrex or Kraken, or simply want to send or receive funds as a wage or "
"business transaction. Funds can be transferred between these source and the "
"Electrum wallet using Dash addresses. Your wallet contains multiple "
"addresses, and will generate new addresses as necessary. Since the Dash "
"blockchain is transparent to the public, it is considered best practice to "
"use a new address for each transaction in order to maintain your privacy."
