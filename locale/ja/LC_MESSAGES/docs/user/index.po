"Based on the Bitcoin project, Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and "
"scalable payments system in the world. In addition to Bitcoin's feature set,"
" Dash currently also offers instant transactions (:ref:`instantsend`), "
"private transactions (:ref:`coinjoin`) and operates a self-governing and "
"self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals and "
"businesses for work that adds value to the network. This :ref:`decentralized"
" governance and budgeting system <governance>` makes it one of the first "
"ever successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)."

"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"is that transactions occur directly between two parties without any central "
"authority to facilitate the transaction. This also means that you are "
"responsible for your own security - there is no bank or credit card company "
"to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. In this sense, it"
" is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency can be spent locally and "
"internationally with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds "
"to the right destination."
