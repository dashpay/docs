"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"in comparison with the traditional banking system is that transactions occur"
" **directly between two parties without any central authority** to "
"facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you are responsible for "
"your own security** - there is no bank or credit card company to reverse a "
"transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. If you forget or lose your "
"wallet file, recovery phrase or PIN, you will permanently and irrevocably "
"lose access to your funds."

"Dash is designed from the ground up to be fast, secure, fungible and "

"confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For these reasons,"
" the Dash documentation has a strong focus on safety and understanding the "
"concepts and features that drive the Dash ecosystem."
