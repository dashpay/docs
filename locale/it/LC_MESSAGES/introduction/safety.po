"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand "
"in comparison with the traditional banking system is that transactions occur"
" **directly between two parties without any central authority** to "
"facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you are responsible for "
"your own security** - there is no bank or credit card company to reverse a "
"transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. If you forget or lose your "
"wallet file, recovery phrase or PIN, you will permanently and irrevocably "

"Se sei nuovo alle criptovalute, il cambiamento più importante da capire "
"rispetto al sistema bancario tradizionale è che le transazioni avvengono ** "
"direttamente tra due parti senza alcuna autorità centrale ** per facilitare "
"la transazione. Ciò significa anche che ** sei responsabile della tua "
"sicurezza **: non esistono banche o società emittenti di carte di credito "
"per annullare una transazione se i tuoi fondi vengono rubati o persi. Se "
"dimentichi o perdi il file del portafoglio, la frase di ripristino o il PIN,"
" perderai definitivamente e irrevocabilmente l'accesso ai tuoi fondi."

"Dash is designed from the ground up to be fast, secure, fungible and "
