"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is necessary."
" This applies to barter systems as well as economies using currency as a "
"medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a private ledger, "
"cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses on a distributed "
"public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access the balance stored "
"on each public address are therefore the object of value in this system. "
"This section of the documentation discusses different practical methods of "
"keeping these keys safe in wallets, while still remaining useful for day-to-"
"day needs."

"Dash Core Wallet is the full official release of Dash, and supports all Dash"
" features as they are released, including InstantSend and PrivateSend, as "
"well as an RPC console and governance features. Dash Core Wallet (sometimes "
"known as the QT wallet, due to the QT software framework used in "
"development) is a professional or heavy wallet which downloads the full "
"blockchain (several GB in size) and can operate as both a full node or "
"masternode on the network. Because of the requirement to hold a full copy of"
" the blockchain, some time is required for synchronisation when starting the"
" wallet. Once this is done, the correct balances will be displayed and the "
"functions in the wallet can be used. Dash Core Wallet is available for "
"macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi and Windows."

"Dash Electrum is a light wallet which uses powerful external servers to "

" called Secure Payment Verification (SPV), which only requires the block "
"headers and not the full block. This means that wallet startup is almost "
"instant, while still keeping your funds secure and mobile. Dash Electrum "
"also supports advanced InstantSend, PrivateSend and masternode features."

"A hardware wallet is a type of device which stores private keys for a "
"blockchain in a secure hardware device, instead of in a database file such "
"as wallet.dat used with common software wallets. This offers major security "
"advantages over software wallets, as well as practical benefits over paper "
"wallets. To date, there is no verifiable evidence of hardware wallets being "
"compromised by viruses, and they are also immune to keylogger attacks that "
"could be used to steal passwords to unlock the private keys used with "
"software wallets."

"Hardware wallets function by storing your private keys in a protected area "
"of a microcontroller. It is impossible for the private key to leave the "

" computer or smartphone. Most hardware wallets feature a screen which allows"
