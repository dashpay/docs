"Developed by Czech startup `SatoshiLabs <https://satoshilabs.com>`_, the $99"

"By virtue of its design, Trezor can be used to sign transactions on 'unsafe'"
" computers and is impervious to keyloggers and many other vectors of attack,"
" so even if your host PC is compromised, the attacker has no way of getting "
"your private key. That's also where the device gets its name, as 'trezor' "
"translates into 'vault' in most Slavic languages, including Czech. A kind of"
" 'vault' for your private bitcoin key, Trezor claims to use a number of "
"clever tricks to maintain security even on compromised and unsafe machines."
