"Dash wallets function by securely storing the private keys used to create"
" transactions using publicly visible addresses on a distributed ledger "
"called a blockchain. In some cases, it may be necessary to verify an "
"address to demonstrate control of the funds that it holds, that you can "
"receive using the address, or even to verify your identity to an exchange"
" that has previously seen a transaction from that address. To avoid "
"phishing attacks, take great care when sending signed messages to parties"
" you do not trust, since ambiguously worded messages could be used to "
"impersonate your identity."

"Signing messages requires a private key. Verifying messages requires a "
"public address. In this way, you can write an arbitrary message and "
"generate a signature that could only have been created by a user with "
"control of the private key for this address. Any user with the message, "
"the public address and the signature can easily verify that only you "
"could have created the signature. Messages are not stored on the "
"blockchain. Instead, you must send these three text snippets (message, "
"address and signature) to your intended recipient using another "
"communication channel, such as email. As an example, you can test the "
"following message and signature and verify that it was signed by the "
"given address::"
