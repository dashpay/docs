"as InstantSend and CoinJoin, as the and instant transaction and privacy "
"features in Dash are called. The masternodes are paid for this service, "
"using a concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition to the Proof "
"of Work done by miners to secure the blockchain. Masternodes are also "
"allowed to vote on :ref:`governance and funding proposals <governance>`, "

"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "
"decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant "
"fraction of the masternodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with "
"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 1000 Dash. The "
"coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need to be kept in a "
"certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves or"
" spends those coins, the masternode stops working and payment ceases."

"Cualquiera puede ejecutar un masternode. El objetivo es tener suficiente "
"descentralización para garantizar que ninguna persona controle una fracción "
"significativa de los masternodes. Sin embargo, para evitar el "
"congestionamiento de la red con masternodes innecesarios o el fomento de "
"operadores imprudentes, hay una condición que debe cumplirse: prueba de "
"propiedad de 1000 Dash. No es necesario que las monedas estén en el "
"masternode, pero deben mantenerse de una manera que sea transparente para "
"toda la red. Si el propietario mueve o gasta esas monedas, el masternode "
"deja de funcionar y el pago cesa."

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the InstantSend, CoinJoin and "

" masternodes, 45% to miners and 10% to the budget. In practice, half of the "
"reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners. "
"Masternodes are selected for payment in each block (approximately every 2.6 "
"minutes) from a deterministic masternode list, and moved to the back of the "
"list after payment. As more masternodes are created, the duration between "
"payments increases. If the collateral behind a masternode is spent, or if a "
"masternode stops providing services to the network for more than one hour, "
