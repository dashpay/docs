":ref:`CoinJoin` works by creating denominations of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and "
"0.001 DASH and then creating CoinJoin transactions with other users using "
"these denominations. Creation of the denominations is charged at the default"
" fee for a standard transaction. Using CoinJoin is free, but to prevent spam"
" attacks, an average of one in ten CoinJoin transactions are charged a fee "
"of 0.0001 DASH. Spending denominated inputs using CoinJoin incurs the usual "
"standard fees, but to avoid creating a potentially identifiable change "
"address, the fee is always rounded up to the lowest possible denomination. "
"This is typically 0.001 DASH, so it is important to deduct the fee from the "
"amount being sent if possible to minimise fees. Combining InstantSend and "
"CoinJoin may be expensive due to this requirement and the fact that a "
"CoinJoin transaction may require several inputs, while InstantSend charges a"
" fee of 0.0001 DASH per input. Always check your fees before sending a "
"transaction."

"`Dash Evolution <https://www.dash.org/roadmap/>`_ is the code name for a "
"decentralized platform built on Dash blockchain technology. The goal is to "
"provide simple access to the unique features and benefits of Dash to assist "
"in the creation of decentralized technology. Dash introduces a tiered "
"network design, which allows users to do various jobs for the network, along"
" with decentralized API access and a decentralized file system."

"establishes `DIP6 Long Living Masternode Quorums "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md>`__. Expected in "
"late 2019, Dash Core 1.0 will introduce key Evolution features such as "
