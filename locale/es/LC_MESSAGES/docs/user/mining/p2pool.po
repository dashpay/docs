"This guide describes how to set up a Dash P2Pool node to manage a pool of"
" miners. Unlike centralized mining pools, P2Pool is based on the same "
"peer-2-peer (P2P) model as Dash, making the pool as a whole highly "
"resistant to malicious attacks, and preserving and protecting the "
"decentralized nature of Dash. When you launch a P2Pool node, it seeks "
"out, connects with, and shares data with a decentralized network of other"
" P2Pool nodes (also known as peers). P2Pool nodes share a cryptographic "
"chain of data representing value, similar to Dash's blockchain. The "
"P2Pool version is called the sharechain. The decentralized and fair "
"nature of this mining model means mining with P2Pool is strongly "
"encouraged. P2Pool for Dash uses the `p2pool-dash "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/p2pool-dash>`_ software on GitHub, which is a"
" fork of p2pool for Bitcoin. For more information, see `here "
"<https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool>`__."

"Because of the way P2Pool manages difficulty adjustments on the "
"sharechain, it is important to maintain low latency between the miners "
"and the P2Pool node to avoid miners submitting shares too late to enter "
"the sharechain. When setting up your node, you need to consider its "
"physical and network location relative to the miners you intend to "
"connect to the node. If you operate a mining farm, your P2Pool node "
"should probably be a physical machine on the same local network as your "
"miners. If you plan to operate a public node, it may be best to set up "
"your P2Pool node as a virtual machine in a data center with a high speed "
"connection so geographically close miners can mine to your pool with "
"relatively low latency."

"running P2Pool for Dash. It has been tested with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and "
"Dash 0.16. While a reasonable effort will be made to keep it up to date, "
"it should be possible to modify the instructions slightly to support "
"different versions or operating systems as necessary."

"your provider will most likely provide an option to install this system "

"If you are on a private network behind a router, you will need to set up "
"port forwarding for at least port 8999 (UDP/TCP) for access to the "
"sharechain, as well as port 7903 (UDP/TCP) if you want your node to be "
"accessible to the public. How this is done depends on your particular "
"network router and is therefore beyond the scope of this documentation. "
"An example from the popular DD-WRT open source router distribution is "
"shown below. Guides to setting up port forwarding can be found `here "
