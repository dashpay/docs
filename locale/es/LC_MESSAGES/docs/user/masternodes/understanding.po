"Simply put, a masternode is a server with a full copy of the Dash "
"blockchain, which guarantees a certain minimum level of performance and "
"functionality to perform certain tasks related to block validation, as well "
"as InstantSend and CoinJoin, as the and instant transaction and privacy "
"features in Dash are called. The masternodes are paid for this service, "
"using a concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition to the Proof "
"of Work done by miners to secure the blockchain. Masternodes are also "
"allowed to vote on :ref:`governance and funding proposals <governance>`, "
"with each masternode receiving one vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal "
"submitted to the system."

"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "
"decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant "
"fraction of the masternodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with "
"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of DASH collateral."
" The coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need to be kept in a"
" certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves "
"or spends those coins, the masternode stops working and payment ceases."

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the InstantSend, CoinJoin and "
"governance services they provide. 20% of the block subsidy goes to the "
"budget with the remaining 80% split between miners and masternodes per this "
":ref:`block reward reallocation table <block-reward-reallocation>`. Then, "
"every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is created that"
" contains the entire 20% payout to the budget proposal winners. Masternodes "
"are selected for payment in each block (approximately every 2.6 minutes) "
"from a deterministic masternode list, and moved to the back of the list "
"after payment. As more masternodes are created, the duration between "
"payments increases. If the collateral behind a masternode is spent, or if a "
"masternode stops providing services to the network for more than one hour, "
"it is removed from the list until normal service resumes. In this way, "
"masternodes are given incentive to provide efficient and reliable services "
"to the network."
