msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:14
msgid ""
"Dash Electrum focuses on speed, low resource usage and providing a simple "
"user experience for Dash. Startup times are instant because it operates in "
"conjunction with high-performance servers that handle the most complicated "
"parts of the Dash system."

msgid "Does Dash Electrum trust servers?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:22
msgid ""
"Not really; the Dash Electrum client never sends private keys to the "
"servers. In addition, it verifies the information reported by servers using "
"a technique called `Simple Payment Verification "

"The seed is a random phrase that is used to generate your private keys. "
"Example::"

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:35
msgid ""
"Your wallet can be entirely recovered from its seed. To do this, select the "

msgid "How secure is the seed?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"The seed created by Dash Electrum has 128 bits of entropy. This means that "
"it provides the same level of security as a Dash private key (of length 256 "
"bits). Indeed, an elliptic curve key of length n provides n/2 bits of "
"security."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:49
msgid ""
"The Dash Electrum wallet design and workflow are based on a concept called a"
" “wallet generation seed”. This seed is a unique, randomly- selected list of"
" twelve words. A Dash Electrum wallet uses its seed as a template for "
"generating addresses."
msgstr ""

"Notice that the total balance does not only show the sum of all receiving "
"addresses, but also the separately listed **Change** addresses. Where did "
"these new change addresses come from and why does the first one now hold "
"funds?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:67
msgid ""
"Dash is an electronic cash system, meaning that it shares much in common "
"with the process of using paper banknotes. Although some cash payments "
"involve exact change, many do not. You tend to “overpay” when using cash, "
"and expect to receive the difference as change. Perhaps surprisingly, this "
"is how Dash transactions work as well. If the entire balance of an address "
"is not required for any given transaction, the remainder is sent to a new "
"and unused address under control of the same wallet. This address is "
"generated deterministically (rather than randomly) from the wallet seed, "
"which means that any other wallet will also regenerate the change addresses "
"in the same order from the same recovery seed, and have access to the "
"balances."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/wallets/electrum/faq.rst:79
msgid ""
"Spending the entire balance and sending any remainder to a change address is"
" considered good practice because it prevents the transaction recipient from"
" linking transactions by browsing the blockchain, thus compromising your "
"privacy. If privacy is not a concern, change addresses can be disabled via "
"the **Tools > Electrum preferences** menu option."
