"When you first start your Dash Wallet, you will be prompted to choose "
"between creating a new wallet or recovering an existing wallet. Choose **New"
" Wallet** to create a new wallet unless you have existing funds stored in "
"another wallet using a recovery phrase. Your new wallet will be generated, "
"and a recovery phrase will appear so you can recover the funds later if you "
"lose or damage your phone or need to transfer the account to another device."
" Write the phrase down and store it in a safe place - if you lose this, you "
"will also lose access to your funds forever."

"directly. Once the transfer is complete, you can view your balance, "
"transaction history and the status of any pending transactions by clicking "

"The Send DASH screen gives you two options to enter the payment address: "

"**InstantSend** for instant confirmation, or disable this to send a normal "
"transaction which will require more time for confirmation. Depending on the "
"code you are scanning, the amount of Dash requested may be included, or you "
"can enter it yourself. A confirmation screen will appear to explain the fee "
"structure and request your unlock code (PIN or TouchID). The transaction "
"will then be sent."
