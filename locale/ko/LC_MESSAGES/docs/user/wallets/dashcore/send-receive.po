"Your Dash Core Wallet is associated with a number of unique addresses that "
"can be used to send and receive Dash. Each address holds its own balance, "
"and the sum of all your balances is what appears on the **Overview** tab. "
"When you send Dash, your wallet will automatically transfer funds from as "
"many of your addresses as necessary to the destination address, which is "
"controlled by another Dash user and associated with their wallet. You can "
"control which addresses you use using the Coin Control feature."

"When you confirm a transaction, Dash Core will enter the transaction in a "
"block, which will then be added to the blockchain for other clients to "
"confirm. A transaction is generally considered confirmed once six blocks "
"have been added after the block containing your transaction, although "
"masternode and mining payments are only released after 101 blocks. Note that"
" a different process is used for InstantSend and CoinJoin transactions."
