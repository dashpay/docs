"Your proposal should have a clear title, followed by a short and simple "
"description of the objectives. Explain early in your proposal exactly how"
" it will benefit the Dash network, how much Dash you are requesting, how "
"you arrived at this value, and finally who you are and how you plan to do"
" the work. Masternodes should be able to immediately get an idea of what "
"you are proposing from the first few lines of your proposal."

"Get feedback from the community before you post your proposal to the "

"out if someone has proposed something similar in the past, and whether it"
" succeeded or failed. There are `pre-proposal channels on the forum "
"<https://www.dash.org/forum/topic/pre-budget-proposal- "
"discussions.93/>`__ and `Dash Discord <http://staydashy.com>`__, and "
"`Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay>`__ also attracts a lot of "
"views - consider the discussion on these channels to be the research "
"phase of your proposal. Later, you can post a link to the forum "
"discussion when your proposal goes live to show you are including "

"The Dash community is one of the network's strongest features, and "
"newcomers are always welcome. However, because of the way proposals work,"
" there needs to be reasonable trust that the work promised in the "
"proposal will be completed if it passes. If you are new, consider "
"starting with a smaller proposal first to prove your ability to deliver "
"on time and budget. Attaching your real name or `Keybase "
"<https://keybase.io>`_ identity to a proposal also helps build trust. If "
"you are a making a large proposal, get a team together and nominate (or "
"hire) one person to serve as community liaison, since posting from "
"multiple accounts can be confusing."

"The voting window closes 1662 blocks (or just under 3 days) before the "
"superblock. To give the masternode operators enough time to consider, "
"discuss and vote on your proposal, you must post it well in advance of "
"the voting deadline - it's better to wait for the next superblock than to"
" rush! Most masternodes will see your proposal for the first time once it"
" appears on the blockchain or when you claim it on DashCentral. The first"
" few hours of discussion between masternode owners typically bring up a "
"lot of questions and can be critical to influence opinion and voting, so "
