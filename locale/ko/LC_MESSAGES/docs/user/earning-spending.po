"A range of services and businesses are available to convert your wage to and"
" from Dash as you receive it. It is of course easiest to receive payment "
"from your employer in Dash directly, however this may not always be an "
"option. `Uphold <https://uphold.com>`_ allows you to instantly and "
"automatically convert any received deposits to and from Dash. Building on "
"this functionality, `Bitwage <https://www.bitwage.com>`_ allows you to "
"invoice and receive payment from any employer, practically anywhere in the "
"world, and have a percentage of your wage immediately converted to Dash. You"
" can then withdraw your wage to any Dash wallet for spending or saving. For "
"more information, see the following blog posts:"
