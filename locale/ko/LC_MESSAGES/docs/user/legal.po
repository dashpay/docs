"The purpose of the Dash DAO is to promote, protect and standardize Dash. "
"In the course of our mission, we have received inquiries into how some "
"aspects of Dash are treated under United States law. The purpose of this "
"document is to address the most common of these inquiries and explain how"
" we believe the laws apply to Dash. This is not meant as a legal opinion,"
" and you should consult your own attorneys before relying upon it. "
"However, it is meant to state our position on the law, and how the law "
"should be properly interpreted."

"As many already know, block rewards are paid to masternode operators in "
"exchange for validating transactions on the Dash network. The IRS has "
"stated unequivocally that “when a taxpayer successfully ‘mines’ virtual "
"currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of"
" receipt is includible in gross income.” To be sure, masternodes do not "
"“mine”, but the IRS considers using computer resources to validate "
"Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger "
"to constitute “mining”. By analogy, a masternode operator should also "
"treat as regular income the fair market value of the block reward."

"A Dash user may demonstrate to the network his or her control over 1,000 "
"DASH in order to run a masternode. These tokens never leave the user’s "
"control. If at any point during the user’s tenure as a masternode "
"operator, the user disposes of any or all of the 1,000 DASH, the network "
"automatically strips the user of his or her status as a masternode. Under"
" the US Internal Revenue Code, gain or loss is realized only on the “sale"
" or exchange” of property. The term “sale” generally means the transfer "
"of all right, title, and interest in the property transferred. A number "
"of factors typically are considered to determine whether a sale has "
"occurred, the most important being whether the benefits and burdens of "
"ownership of the transferred property have passed from the transferor to "
"the transferee. In Dash, the masternode operator retains control of the "
"1,000 DASH and simply demonstrates that control to the network. "
"Therefore, the holding of the 1,000 DASH for purposes of qualifying as a "
"masternode operator should not cause a taxable event to occur because the"
" user has not transferred any of the benefits and burdens of ownership."

"Assuming that the 1,000 DASH are sold, whether that Dash is a “capital "
"asset” will determine the tax treatment of the sale. Stocks, bonds and "
"other investment property for example, are generally treated as capital "
"assets. Inventory, depreciable property, and stock in trade, though, are "
"not. Assuming the masternode operator held the 1,000 DASH either for "
"investment purposes or for purposes of qualifying as a masternode "
"operator, the IRS would likely treat gain or loss on the sale of those "
"Dash tokens as capital in nature. Therefore, Dash held for a long enough "
"period of time could be subject to the lower “long term capital gains” "
"tax rate."

"As with cash or any other currency system, users may use Dash in "
"connection with illegal activity. A common question we receive is whether"
" masternode operators can also be liable for criminal activity, simply by"
" relaying transactions related to that activity. The fundamental legal "

"masternode operators."

msgid ""
"Almost all crimes require that a defendant have a defined *mens rea* at "
"the time of an offense. *Mens rea* is a mental state like purposefulness,"
" knowledge, recklessness or negligence. For example, to act with "
"“purpose” is commonly understood as desiring as your “conscious object” "
"the result of a crime. “Knowledge” is a less culpable mindset than "
"“purpose” – acting with “knowledge” requires general awareness that your "
"actions will bring about a particular crime. “Recklessness” requires "
"disregard of a substantial risk. Finally, a person acts “negligently” if "
"they should have been aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of a "
"particular consequence of their actions, but were not."

"Most masternodes have no awareness, while relaying Dash transactions, of "
"the identity of the users involved, the ultimate destination of users’ "

msgid ""
"Even if someone is not the principal actor in the commission of a crime, "
"that person can be secondarily liable for their involvement in it. As "
"such, we are sometimes asked whether masternode operators, by their "
"involvement in relaying Dash transactions, could be “aiding and abetting”"
" or “conspiring” to commit a crime that might involve Dash. Generally "
"speaking, aiding and abetting requires that the defendant (i) seek by his"
" action to make the crime succeed and (ii) act with the same *mens rea* "
"as required for the principal offense."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/legal.rst:122
msgid ""
"No matter the requisite *mens rea* of a particular principal offense "
"committed by a Dash user, it is unlikely that a mere masternode operator,"
" without more, could be found to have “aided and abetted.\" To be sure, "
"the masternodes do provide assistance in the principal offense – in that "
"masternode action is required to process all Dash transactions. However, "
"the masternodes would not have the requisite *mens rea* to satisfy the "
"requirements of aiding and abetting liability. Masternode operators have "
"no readily available information about the purpose or consequences of "
"users’ Dash transactions, or even the originating identity of the sender "
"of funds. As such, so long as a sufficient diversity of non-criminal "
"transactions occur on the Dash network, they would not harbor even the "
"least culpable *mens rea* (i.e. negligence) with respect to a user "
"relaying or receiving Dash in furtherance of a particular crime."

"“Conspiracy” liability is even less likely. Conspiracy generally requires"
" i) an agreement to commit a crime, ii) knowledge of the unlawful purpose"
" of the agreement, iii) intent to further the unlawful purpose, and iv) "
"an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. None of these requirements are "
"met by mere masternode operators."

"The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) is the law that primarily governs exchanges in"
" the United States. The BSA does not contain any prohibition on "
"supporting Dash transactions. Indeed, the BSA take a flexible, risk- "
"based approach to regulation and contemplate that financial institutions "
"will enter into lines of business with new risks. This risk-based "
"approach requires, at the outset, an independent risk assessment. By and "
"large, the risks faced by exchanges who begin to support Dash will be "
"similar to the risks associated with other virtual currencies. One "
"significant difference concerns PrivateSend transactions, and we focus on"
" this difference below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user/legal.rst:160
msgid ""
"PrivateSend transactions obfuscate the source and destination addresses "
"of funds, thus blockchain forensic techniques like clustering analysis "

"PrivateSend transactions are used for legitimate purposes and are often "
"required to achieve personal or commercial privacy for sensitive "
"transactions. The use of PrivateSend transactions is not inherently "
"suspicious. Combination with other factors, including those identified in"
" the exchange’s own risk assessment, may raise PrivateSend transactions "
"to the level of suspicious activity."

"Exchanges should consider revising their risk assessments and AML "
