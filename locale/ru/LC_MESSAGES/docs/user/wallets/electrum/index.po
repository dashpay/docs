"Dash Electrum is a light wallet which uses powerful external servers to "
"index the blockchain, while still securing the keys on your personal "
"computer. Transactions are verified on the Dash blockchain using a technique"
" called Secure Payment Verification (SPV), which only requires the block "
"headers and not the full block. This means that wallet startup is almost "
"instant, while still keeping your funds secure and mobile. Dash Electrum "
"also supports advanced InstantSend, CoinJoin and masternode features."

"Bitcoin Electrum features (mostly identical in Dash Electrum) is available "
"at the `official documentation site <https://docs.electrum.org>`_."
