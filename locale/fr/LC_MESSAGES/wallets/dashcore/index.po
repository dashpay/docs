"This documentation describes the Dash Core Wallet and how to use its basic "
"functions. Since the functionality is similar across all supported platforms"
" (Windows, macOS, Linux), the instructions and screenshots will reference "
"the Windows software, highlighting differences between the platforms where "
"necessary. See here for separate installation guides specific to each "
"platform."

"The Dash Core Wallet (sometimes known as the QT wallet, due to the QT "
"software framework used in development) is a professional or heavy wallet "
"which downloads the full blockchain (several GB in size), operates as a full"
" node on the network and offers all functions available to Dash. When the "
"wallet starts up, some time is required for it to synchronise its copy of "
"the blockchain with the network. Once this is done, the correct balances "
"will be displayed and the functions in the wallet can be used."
