===============
Getting Started
===============

Dash welcomes new merchants and supports integration through a
standardised onboarding process. It's easy to begin accepting payments
in Dash and enjoy the following benefits:

- Settlement within seconds and clearance within minutes
- Ability to accept payments from any market around the world
- Irreversible transactions to prevent fraud
- Advanced privacy for both customers and merchants
- Lowest fees in the industry

To get started with an integration in your sales system, simply select
an online or point of sale payment solution from the lists below. If you
are unsure, GoCoin is a popular choice due its support for
:ref:`InstantSend <instantsend>`, while CoinPayments supports the
largest range of online shop software. Anypay is an incredibly simple
solution for retail stores, and also supports InstantSend. Larger
integrations may require some customisation or cooperation with a
specialist payment processor such as `ePaymints
<https://epaymints.com/>`__. This documentation also describes the
:ref:`administrative <merchants-administrative>` and  :ref:`technical
<integration>` steps required to integrate various Dash services.

Any Dash received in payment can be automatically converted to the fiat
currency of your choice using services such as `Uphold
<https://uphold.com>`_. Simply select the card for the target currency
and click **Add funds** -> **With cryptocurrency**. Any cryptocurrency
deposited to this address will immediately be converted to the target
fiat currency at the time of deposit.

Many major merchants accept Dash - check out `Bitrefill
<https://www.bitrefill.com>`__ or `CheapAir
<https://www.cheapair.com>`__ for examples of what merchant integration
can look like. Once you are up and running accepting Dash, consider
adding your business to the directory maintained at `Discover Dash
<https://discoverdash.com>`_ for increased visibility.

Dash. This guide assumes you have already `installed Wordpress
<https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress>`_, `installed
WooCommerce <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/installing-
uninstalling-woocommerce/>`_ and `created at least one product
<https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/>`_ in your
store.

Go to the `gocoin-woocommerce GitHub Releases page
<https://github.com/GoCoin/gocoin-woocommerce/releases>`_ and download a

Point-of-Sale with Spark
------------------------

`Spark Payments <https://get-spark.com>`__ allows you to quickly start
accepting point-of-sale payments in Dash at a physical store. The system
works as an app, and is available for Android, macOS, Windows and Linux,
with an iOS progressive web app (`PWA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps>`_) in development.

The project is an external terminal application for processing Dash
payments in brick and mortar stores. The merchant types the sale amount
in their local currency (94 currencies supported), the application will
generate a QR code sale for the proper amount of Dash for the customer
to scan. Then the terminal will provide feedback on the status of the
payment (received, timed out, partial, instantsend or regular), and if
set up - fiat conversion through `uphold.com <https://uphold.com>`_. A
guide on how to set up Spark with Uphold to convert payments to fiat
currency is available in 
`English <https://github.com/dashpay/docs/raw/master/merchants/Spark-Payments-Uphold-English.pdf>`__ 
and 
`German <https://github.com/dashpay/docs/raw/master/merchants/Spark-Payments-Uphold-German.pdf>`__.

To use Spark, open the app on your device. If this is the first time you
are using the app, you will need to specify a Dash address to receive
payments from the system, as well as your chosen fiat currency. You can
change this information at any time from the menu. To generate a payment
invoice, enter the amount in fiat currency. Spark will generate a QR
code containing your specified address and the requested amount,
denominated in Dash. The customer scans the QR code, and the app will
display a visual indication when payment is complete.

   Configuring and receiving payment using Spark Payments

Payment systems like Anypay and Spark can be integrated with your
existing terminal and/or accounting software (such as Square Register,
by recording sales invoiced in Dash as an **Other Payment Type** in the
system. This allows you to keep track of your Dash income as easily as
if you were accepting cash.
