Dash User Documentation

The official Dash documentation is oriented towards the average user and serves to describe all aspects of the Dash ecosystem, ranging from information for new users through to guides on more difficult tasks such as maintaining a masternode. This user documentation is available at https://docs.dash.org, while developer documentation is maintained separately at https://docs.dash.org/core and https://dashplatform.readme.io/.
