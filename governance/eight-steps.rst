8 Steps to a Successful Proposal
================================

Proposals in the Dash governance system are subject to voting by
masternodes. So, like any voting, you need to convince the voters that
your proposal should pass. Here are some key points to consider in every
proposal:

Keep your proposal clear
  Your proposal should have a clear title, followed by a short and
  simple description of the objectives. Explain early in your proposal
  exactly how it will benefit the Dash network, how much Dash you are
  requesting, how you arrived at this value, and finally who you are and
  how you plan to do the work. Masternodes should be able to immediately
  get an idea of what you are proposing from the first few lines of your
  proposal.

Run a pre-proposal discussion
  Get feedback from the community before you post your proposal to the
  blockchain. A discussion period of around two weeks will help you find
  out if someone has proposed something similar in the past, and whether
  it succeeded or failed. There are `pre-proposal channels on the forum
  <https://www.dash.org/forum/topic/pre-budget-proposal-
  discussions.93/>`__ and `Dash Discord <http://staydashy.com>`__,
  and `Reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay>`__ also attracts a lot
  of views - consider the discussion on these channels to be the
  research phase of your proposal. Later, you can post a link to the
  forum discussion when your proposal goes live to show you are
  including community feedback in your work.

Manage your identity and reputation
  The Dash community is one of the network's strongest features, and
  newcomers are always welcome. However, because of the way proposals
  work, there needs to be reasonable trust that the work promised in the
  proposal will be completed if it passes. If you are new, consider
  starting with a smaller proposal first to prove your ability to
  deliver on time and budget. Attaching your real name or `Keybase
  <https://keybase.io>`_ identity to a proposal also helps build trust.
  If you are a making a large proposal, get a team together and nominate
  (or hire) one person to serve as community liaison, since posting from
  multiple accounts can be confusing.

Run an enthusiastic campaign for your proposal
  Proposals with a video or website have a far greater chance of
  succeeding! Uploading a video gives your proposal a human touch and a
  chance to convey your enthusiasm in a way that isn't always possible
  in text. Post your video to the `forum
  <https://www.dash.org/forum/topic/pre-budget-proposal-
  discussions.93/>`_ and `DashCentral
  <https://www.dashcentral.org/budget>`_, become a regular on Discord
  or run a webinar to explain the proposal and answer questions. Put
  some work in before you ask for funding to demonstrate your
  involvement with Dash - but don't be annoying and spam many channels
  asking for votes.

Demonstrate your commitment to the network
  If you are asking for significant funding to start up or expand a
  for-profit business built on Dash, you need to explain why and for how
  long this funding is required, and what you are offering in return. It
  can be very helpful to show you have skin in the game by matching the
  contribution provided in Dash with funds from your own business or
  investors. Equity or exclusivity agreements can be reached with `Dash
  Core Group, Inc. <bradley.zastrow@dash.org>`_, but must be clarified
  in writing before the proposal is posted.

Post your proposal early and make yourself available for questions
  The voting window closes 1662 blocks (or just under 3 days) before the
  superblock. To give the masternode operators enough time to consider,
  discuss and vote on your proposal, you must post it well in advance of
  the voting deadline - it's better to wait for the next superblock than
  to rush! Most masternodes will see your proposal for the first time
  once it appears on the blockchain or when you claim it on DashCentral.
  The first few hours of discussion between masternode owners typically
  bring up a lot of questions and can be critical to influence opinion
  and voting, so make yourself available during this time.

Keep the community updated when your proposal passes
  Your proposal should include details of how you plan to keep the
  community and network informed of your work. Meet your commitments and
  post regular reports so your output is clear, and make yourself
  available on social channels to answer questions. Remember, your
  ability to pass future proposals depends on your demonstrated ability
  to deliver and communicate.

Consider arrangements for large requests
  If you are requesting a significant amount of funding, there is an
  understandable concern that you will deliver on your promises to the
  network. Reach out to the `Dash Investment Foundation 
  <https://www.dashinvests.org/>`_ in advance for advice on escrow or 
  providing equity, and make the conditions public and part of the 
  proposal. If your proposal is so large that uses a significant 
  percentage of the budget, there is a risk that approving your 
  proposal will bump smaller proposals out of the budget. Consider 
  breaking your proposal into smaller monthly payments instead.

See :ref:`this documentation <using-governance>` for specific
instructions on how to create a proposal when you are ready. Good luck!

For an example of good reporting, reputation management and use of a
video to request funding in a pre-proposal, see this video from Amanda
B. Johnson's extremely popular **DASH: Detailed** proposal:

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow: hidden; max-width: 70%; height: auto;">
        <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NuJZwmpMlVA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>
    </div>

A few additional points:

#. It is currently not possible to change the payment address after
   the proposal is posted to the blockchain.
    
#. To avoid accusations of favouritism and inside trading, Dash Core
   cannot promote your proposal for you. If your proposal is an
   integration, reach out to the business development team in advance.
   Once your product is live, it may be possible to announce it from
   Dash Core channels.
    
#. If your proposal is for news, promotion or marketing, make sure you
   synchronise your efforts with major existing organisations such as
   Dash Force News or marketing firms contracted by Dash Core.
    
#. You are responsible for your own planning to hedge against price
   volatility. If your proposal involves significant payments to third
   parties in fiat currency, reach out to the `Dash Investment Foundation 
   <https://www.dashinvests.org/>`_ in advance for advice on escrow, 
   price maintenance, converting currencies and hedging against volatility.
    
#. For the same reason, it is not recommended to request funding for
   period of longer than three months. Masternodes don't want to see and
   vote on the same proposal without updates several months in a row,
   and price volatility makes it a risky proposition both to the network
   and yourself.
    
#. Before entering your budget proposal on the blockchain, check how
   many proposals already exist for the current budget cycle. If it is
   likely to become very crowded or if some proposals are requesting a
   significant portion of the budget, voting is likely to be very
   competitive with weaker projects being forced out of the budget, even
   if they collect sufficient votes to pass the 10% threshold. See
   :ref:`here <understanding-governance>` for more details.
