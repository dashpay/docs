====================
Earning and Spending
====================

Dash is designed from the ground up to function as digital cash. This
documentation discusses how and where Dash users can manage all of their
personal finances using Dash.

Earning
=======

A range of services and businesses are available to convert your wage to
and from Dash as you receive it. It is of course easiest to receive
payment from your employer in Dash directly, however this may not always
be an option. `Uphold <https://uphold.com>`_ allows you to instantly and
automatically convert any received deposits to and from Dash. Building
on this functionality, `Bitwage <https://www.bitwage.com>`_ allows you
to invoice and receive payment from any employer, practically anywhere
in the world, and have a percentage of your wage immediately converted
to Dash. You can then withdraw your wage to any Dash wallet for spending
or saving. For more information, see the following blog posts:

Debit Cards
-----------

Debit cards work by prepaying in Dash to load the account, then
withdrawing cash from an ATM or spending online or anywhere debit/credit
cards are supported. The Dash is either exchanged at the time of
purchase or in advance. For an overview and review of all available and
upcoming cards, including cards funded by the Dash budget system, see
`this article on Dash Force News <https://dashnews.org/debit-card-proposal-reviews/>`_.

The rapidly evolving approach to regulation of cryptocurrencies such as
Dash and instant exchange solutions such as ShapeShift means that
availability of debit cards cannot be guaranteed in any or all
jurisdictions. Check with the following providers for updates on the
availability of Dash debit cards.
