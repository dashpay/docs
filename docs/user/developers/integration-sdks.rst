SDK Resources
=============

SDKs (Software Development Kits) are used to accelerate the design and
development of a product for the Dash Network. These resources can
either be used to interface with an API provider or for the creation of
standalone applications by forming transactions and/or performing
various wallet functions.

The Dash Developer Portal aims to provide the information you need to
understand Dash and start building Dash-based applications. To make the
best use of this documentation, you may want to install the current
version of Dash Core and Dash Platform, either from source, from a
pre-compiled executable or from Docker Hub.

Dashcore is a fork of Bitcore and operates as a full Dash node â€” your
apps run directly on the peer-to-peer network. For wallet application
development, additional indexes have been added into Dash for querying
address balances, transaction history, and unspent outputs.
