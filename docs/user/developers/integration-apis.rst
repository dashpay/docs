API Services
============

Several API services exist to facilitate quick and easy integration with
the Dash network for services including:

- Transaction broadcasting
- Exchange rates
- Currency conversion
- Invoice generation

API Services are typically leveraged to eliminate that requirement of
running your own infrastructure to support blockchain interactions. This
includes mechanisms such as:

- Forming and Broadcasting a Transaction to the network.
- Address generation using HD Wallets.
- Payment Processing using WebHooks.

There are a variety of options for supporting these methods, with the
key differentiator being the pricing model included and supported
features. The following list of API Providers attempts to outline these
key features/differentiators and also includes a link to related
documentation.
