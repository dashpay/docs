Dash 0.16 Upgrade Information

Installation notes
==================

Dash Core v0.16 will automatically activate the Block Reward Reallocation
once a threshold percentage of the network has upgraded. Mining pools must
mine an upgraded block to successfully signal the upgrade in a block, and
the threshold percentage of blocks in a window must signal in order to lock
in the upgrade. 

The threshold percentage for this activation is dynamic and will decrease
every 4032 blocks from 80% to 60%, over approximately 10 weeks. The first
window will begin at block 1350720 (on 2020-10-07). Information
regarding the activation threshold and progress can be obtained via Dash
Core's debug console or the command line by using the `getblockchaininfo`
command.

- Activation status can be tracked in the image below or at `this site
  <http://178.254.23.111/~pub/Dash/Dash_Info.html>`__.

- Masternode upgrade status can be tracked at `Dash Ninja <https://www.dashninja.pl/deterministic-masternodes.html>`__

- If you are updating to Dash Core v0.16 from version 0.13.x+ you
  should be able to simply shut down the daemon and replace it with
  the updated binary. Versions <= 0.14.0.3 will run a migration
  process on startup that may take a few minutes.

- If you are updating to Dash Core v0.16 from version < 0.13 please
  note that you will also need to re-index the chainstate using the
  “-reindex-chainstate” command.
