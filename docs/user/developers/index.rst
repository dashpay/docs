The `Dash Platform Developer Documentation <https://dashplatform.readme.io/>`_ 
contains technical documentation intended to help developers quickly and
easily get started with Dash Platform. The :ref:`Dash Core Developer
Documentation <core:core-index>` provides detailed
documentation on the Dash Core code base, and serves as a reference for
experienced developers. These documentation portals can help developers
to quickly and efficiently integrate external applications with the Dash
ecosystem. Anyone can contribute to the documentation by suggesting
edits in the documentation system.

The Dash Core Team also maintains the `Dash Roadmap
<https://www.dash.org/roadmap/>`_, which sets out delivery milestones for
future releases of Dash and includes specific technical details
describing how the development team plans to realise each challenge. The
Dash Roadmap is complemented by the `Dash Improvement Proposals
<https://github.com/dashpay/dips>`_, which contain detailed technical
explanations of proposed changes to the Dash protocol itself.

The Dash community organise discussion and development of Dash apps
using the following resources:

- `Awesome Dash Platform <https://dashdevs.org/>`__
- `Dash Dapp Devs Discord <https://chat.dashdevs.org>`__
- `Dash Bounty Board <https://trello.com/invite/b/FPJzDcok/ea9fc798043d35d61aa8a5df0917cba7/dash-bounty-board>`__

The remaining sections available below describe practical steps to
carry out common development tasks in Dash.
