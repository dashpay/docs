  dashmate update

Finally, restart dashmate::
   
  dashmate start

Troubleshooting
===============

.. warning::

   Only enable logs if you have :ref:`configured log rotation <dashmate-log-rotation>` to avoid
   running out of disk space.

The following sections describe how to enable log rotation, set up file logging for Core and
Platform, adjust log levels, and collect the logs for analysis.

Dashmate log overview
---------------------

Dashmate logs for each service are stored within its Docker container. Although this is typically
sufficient, more advanced options are sometimes needed to adjust the log level, output format,
or destination. Several cases include when you need to: 

* Modify the level of detail provided in the logs (e.g., debug vs info)
* Provide data to a log server (e.g., `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch>`_)
* Store persistent file logs external to the Docker containers
* Use log monitoring tools to track service health

For example, since the default dashmate logs are only stored in the Docker containers, they are lost
if the container is removed for some reason (new Docker image, dashmate reset, failure, etc.).
Therefore, you may want to store persistent log files external to Docker while troubleshooting an
issue to ensure valuable log data cannot be lost.

.. _dashmate-log-rotation:

Set up log rotation
-------------------

By default, dashmate logs are not written to the docker host file system. At times you may want to
write them to the host file system. Before enabling logging, it is important to configure log
rotation to avoid running out of disk space. 

Create a new logrotate configuration file for dashmate logs:

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/platform-logs

Paste in the following configuration and replace the example path one that matches your system. This
example configuration rotates logs daily and retains seven historical files for each log file type.
Historical files are each limited to 1GB.

::

   /home/ubuntu/logs/*.log {
     rotate 7
     daily
     maxsize 1G
     missingok
     notifempty
     copytruncate
     compress
     delaycompress
   }

Press **Ctrl + X** to close the editor and **Y** and **Enter** save the file.

.. tip::

   For additional log rotation details, see `this configuration tutorial
   <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-logfiles-with-logrotate-on-ubuntu-22-04>`_
   or check out the `logrotate man pages
   <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man8/logrotate.8.html>`_.

.. _dashmate-logs-core:

Configure Core logs
-------------------

Enable logging to file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``dashmate config set`` to configure a location for storing Core logs on the host file system.
Replace the example path with one that matches your system:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set core.log.filePath "/home/ubuntu/core-debug.log"

.. _dashmate-logs-core-debug:

Toggle debug logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable debug logging for additional details, run the following command. Debug logs can be
turned off by setting the value back to ``false``:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set core.log.debug.enabled true

.. dropdown:: Advanced debug logging

   Dashmate supports some advanced debug log options provided by Dash Core. The following
   boolean ``core.log.debug`` settings correspond directly to the parameters described in the `Core
   documentation
   <https://docs.dash.org/projects/core/en/stable/docs/dashcore/wallet-arguments-and-commands-dashd.html#debugging-testing-options>`_:
   ``ips``, ``sourceLocations``, ``threadNames``, and ``timeMicros``.

View current log settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the current Core log settings, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config get core.log

Disable logging to file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To disable logging to a file outside the container, reset the log path to ``null``:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set core.log.filePath null

.. _dashmate-logs-platform:

Configure Platform logs
-----------------------

For troubleshooting flexibility, dashmate provides independent log configuration for the Platform
Gateway, Drive ABCI, and Tenderdash. Each service can be configured with the most helpful log level
and output format.

.. _dashmate-logs-platform-gateway:

Gateway logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Platform gateway has two types of logs: service logs and access logs. Service logs are directed
to stdout, while access logs can be configured to go to stdout, stderr, or to a file. If all logs
are directed to stdout, the output will be a mixture of service and access data.

**Enable file logging**

Use ``dashmate config set`` to configure a location for storing Platform gateway access logs on the
host file system. The example below adds file logging while also keeping the default stdout logging.
Replace the example path with one that matches your system:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set platform.gateway.log.accessLogs '[
      {
         "type": "file",
         "format": "text",
         "path": "/home/ubuntu/logs/gateway.log",
         "template": null
      },      
      {
         "type": "stdout",
         "format": "text",
         "template": null
      }
   ]'

**Disable file logging**

To disable logging to a file, remove the file config from the accessLogs setting:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set platform.gateway.log.accessLogs '[
      {
         "type": "stdout",
         "format": "text",
         "template": null
      }
   ]'

**Change log level**

Platform gateway service logs support several levels of detail. In increasing order of detail they
are: ``critical``, ``error``, ``warn``, ``info`` (default), ``debug``, and ``trace``. To disable
service logs, set the log level to ``off``. 

The log level can be changed by using ``dashmate config set`` to update the
``platform.gateway.log.level`` value. For example, run these commands to change the gateway service
log level to debug on your dashmate node:

.. code-block:: shell

  dashmate config set platform.gateway.log.level debug
  dashmate restart --platform

**View log settings**

To view the current Platform gateway log settings, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config get platform.gateway.log

.. _dashmate-logs-platform-abci:

Drive ABCI logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Enable file logging**

Use ``dashmate config set`` to configure a location for storing Platform ABCI logs on the host
file system. Replace the example path with one that matches your system:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.logs '{
      "stdout": {
         "destination":"stdout",
         "level": "info",
         "format":"compact",
         "color":true
      }, 
      "file": {
         "destination": "/home/ubuntu/logs/drive-abci.log",
         "level": "info",
         "format": "compact",
         "color": true
      }
   }'

**Disable file logging**

To disable logging to a file, remove the file config from the logs setting:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.logs '{
      "stdout": {
         "destination":"stdout",
         "level": "info",
         "format":"compact",
         "color":true
      }
   }'

**Change log level**

Drive ABCI logs support several levels of detail. In increasing order of detail they are: ``error``,
``warn``, ``info`` (default), ``debug``, and ``trace``. A logging specification string can also be
provided in the RUST_LOG format for more flexibility. To disable service logs, set the log level to
``silent``. 

The log level can be changed by using ``dashmate config set`` to update the
``platform.drive.abci.logs.*.level`` value. For example, run these commands to change the log levels
for file logging and stdout logging to debug on your dashmate node:

.. code-block:: shell

  dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.logs.file.level debug
  dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.logs.stdout.level debug
  dashmate restart --platform

**View log settings**

To view the current Platform gateway log settings, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config get platform.drive.abci.logs

.. _dashmate-logs-platform-tenderdash:

Tenderdash logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Enable file logging**

Use ``dashmate config set`` to configure a location for storing Tenderdash logs on the host file
system. Replace the example path with one that matches your system:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set platform.drive.tenderdash.log.path "/home/ubuntu/logs/drive-tenderdash.log"

**Disable file logging**

To disable logging to a file, set the path back to ``null``:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config set platform.drive.tenderdash.log.path null

**Change log level**

Tenderdash logs support several levels of detail. In increasing order of detail they are:
``error``, ``warn``, ``info`` (default), ``debug``, and ``trace``. A logging
specification string can also be provided in the RUST_LOG format for more flexibility. To disable
service logs, set the log level to ``silent``. 

The log level can be changed by using ``dashmate config set`` to update the
``platform.drive.abci.logs.*.level`` value. For example, run these commands to change the log level
to debug on your dashmate node:

.. code-block:: shell

  dashmate config set platform.drive.tenderdash.log.level debug
  dashmate restart --platform

**View log settings**

To view the current Tenderdash log settings, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   dashmate config get platform.drive.tenderdash.log

.. _dashmate-doctor:

Collect logs
------------

Dashmate includes the doctor command to make troubleshooting and log reporting easier. The dashmate
doctor command collects important debugging data about the masternode and creates a compressed report file
that can be sent to the support team if necessary. This report includes:

- **Operating System**: Details about the architecture, CPU, memory, and swap
- **Docker**: Status and logs (exit codes, stdout, stderr) for each service
- **Core RPC**: Essential details like the best ChainLock, quorums, blockchain information, peers, and masternode status
- **Tenderdash RPC**: Status, genesis, network information, ABCI details, and a consensus state dump
- **Metrics**: Tenderdash and Drive metrics (if enabled in the configuration)

To create a report, run ``dashmate doctor`` and select **Yes**::

   dashmate doctor

.. figure:: img/dashmate-doctor-details.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Run the doctor command

Upon successful completion, the full path to the report archive is displayed.

.. _dashmate-metrics:

Metrics
-------

To provide better network visibility to DCG developers for troubleshooting, volunteers can
contribute metrics to the DCG metrics server.

1. Enable metrics on your dashmate node

   .. code-block:: shell

      dashmate config set platform.gateway.metrics.enabled true
      dashmate config set platform.gateway.metrics.host 0.0.0.0
      dashmate config set platform.gateway.metrics.port 9090
      dashmate config set platform.gateway.admin.enabled true

      dashmate config set platform.gateway.rateLimiter.metrics.enabled true
      dashmate config set platform.gateway.rateLimiter.metrics.host 0.0.0.0
      dashmate config set platform.gateway.rateLimiter.metrics.port 9102

      dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.metrics.enabled true
      dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.metrics.host 0.0.0.0
      dashmate config set platform.drive.abci.metrics.port 29090

      dashmate config set platform.drive.tenderdash.metrics.enabled true
      dashmate config set platform.drive.tenderdash.metrics.host 0.0.0.0
      dashmate config set platform.drive.tenderdash.metrics.port 26660

      dashmate restart --platform 

2. Grant access to metrics from the DCG metrics server (34.219.3.238) by updating your network
   configuration (i.e., your firewall, AWS security groups, etc.)

3. Provide DCG with your IP address and port so it can be added to the DCG Prometheus server
