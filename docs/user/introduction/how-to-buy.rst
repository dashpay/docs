How To Buy
==========

Dash can be purchased and sold in several ways, each with different
advantages and disadvantages. The following options are available:

.. _exchanges:

- Exchanges are one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrency. A
  wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly different
  features. Some serve different markets, some are in direct
  competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or
  less strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are centralized,
  meaning they are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by
  the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on
  its customers. Others are decentralized, but as a result have higher
  escrow requirements since you are dealing peer-to-peer instead of with
  a trusted entity. Exchanges can be broadly broken down into two
  categories: exchanges which accept national currency (fiat money) and
  exchanges which deal in cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges
  should not be used as wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for
  savings.

- Instant exchanges perform a similar function to normal exchanges, but
  without the requirement to log in. They effectively convert one
  currency to another, with some limits on the amount to be exchanged
  and usually at a less advantageous rate. Others may even offer to sell
  cryptocurrency as a credit card purchase.

- Over the counter exchanges have recently appeared to facilitate sale
  of Dash directly from a company to the individual at a specified
  price, or peer-to-peer between individuals at a negotiated price.
  Volume may be limited compared to exchanges, but these services are
  usually much easier to use. More advanced peer-to-peer sites offer
  escrow services for a fee to prevent cheating during the sale between
  two parties who have never met.

- :ref:`ATMs <atms>` accepting card and cash payments in return for crypto are widely
  available. Mapping services can show the specific location of these
  machines, or you can even set one up at your own business and earn a
  percentage of sales.
