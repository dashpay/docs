Safety
======

If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to
understand in comparison with the traditional banking system is that
transactions occur **directly between two parties without any central
authority** to facilitate the transaction. This also means that **you
are responsible for your own security** - there is no bank or credit
card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost.
If you forget or lose your wallet file, recovery phrase or PIN, you will
permanently and irrevocably lose access to your funds.

Dash is designed from the ground up to be fast, secure, fungible and
private. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but
cryptocurrency can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease,
if you are confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For
these reasons, the Dash documentation has a strong focus on safety and
understanding the concepts and features that drive the Dash ecosystem.

A few general safety guidelines:

- Do not trust any online service or person because they sound or look
  reputable. Always use an escrow service if you are buying peer-to-
  peer.
- Store your Dash on a :ref:`hardware wallet <dash-hardware-wallet>` if 
  possible. If not, then store your coins in the official 
  :ref:`Dash Core Wallet <dash-core-wallet>` or the official 
  :ref:`Dash Electrum Wallet <dash-electrum-wallet>`.
- Do not use exchanges as wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for
  savings.
- Mobile wallets should be used for day-to-day purchases, but do not
  keep large amounts of funds in them. Transfer funds as necessary.

A list of known scams, fake wallets and Ponzi or pyramid schemes can be
seen below. Do NOT trust them.


Impersonation
=============

Scammers may attempt to impersonate well-known community members and
manipulate you into granting them access to your system or wallets. This
is usually done via private messages on the forum, Discord or email. The
attacks are often targeted against masternode owners. If you require
technical assistance, it is best to ask in a public channel/forum or go
to https://support.dash.org and open a ticket. If you engage in personal
chat with a well-known community member, verify their identity by their
chat history or through their publicly available cryptographic keys. All
community members and `Dash Core Group staff <https://www.dash.org/team/>`__
will be able to verify their identity using signed PGP messages.
Identities can also be verified on Keybase:

Ponzi Schemes
=============

A `Ponzi scheme <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme>`_, `Pyramid
scheme <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme>`_ or `Multi-level
marketing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing>`_ are a
fraudulent investment operations where the operator provides fabricated
reports and generates returns for older investors through revenue paid
by new investors. More and more users must constantly join the scheme in
order for it to continue operation, with ever greater numbers of people
losing money to the originators of the scheme.
