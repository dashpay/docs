=============
What is Dash?
=============

Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features :ref:`instant
transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection,
optional :ref:`privacy <coinjoin>` equal to that of physical cash, a
:ref:`self-governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` 
driven by :ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a 
`clear roadmap <https://www.dash.org/roadmap/>`_ for on-chain scaling to
up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While
Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the
Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant
improvements in transaction speed, privacy and governance. This section
of the documentation describes these and many more key features that set
Dash apart in the blockchain economy.

.. _whitepaper:

Whitepaper
----------

The Dash Whitepaper describes the original unique value proposition and
key innovations in Dash from an academic and theoretical perspective. It
is a historical document available as a GitHub wiki, and no longer
receives updates as new features or architectural changes are
implemented. Instead, these features are described in successive Dash
Improvement Proposals (DIPs), while larger architectural changes are
described in separate whitepapers. Features backported from Bitcoin are
described in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).
