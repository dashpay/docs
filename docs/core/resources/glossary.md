# Glossary

## 51 percent attack

The ability of someone controlling a majority of network hash rate to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from confirming.

## Address

A 20-byte hash formatted using base58check to produce either a P2PKH or P2SH Dash address. Currently the most common way users exchange payment information.

## Base58

The method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format. Not the same as other base58 implementations.

## Base58check

The method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format. Not the same as other base58 implementations.

## BIP32

The Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP32), which allows creating child keys from parent keys in a hierarchy. Wallets using the HD protocol are called HD wallets.

## BIP70 payment protocol

The protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers.

## Block

One or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain.

## Block chain

A chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain.

## Block header

An 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work.

## Block height

The number of blocks preceding a particular block on a block chain. For example, the genesis block has a height of zero because zero block preceded it.

## Block reward

The amount that miners may claim as a reward for creating a block. Equal to the sum of the [block subsidy](#block-subsidy) (newly available duffs) plus the transactions fees paid by transactions included in the block.

## Block subsidy

The amount of new Dash created in each block. It comprises the non-fee part of the [block reward](#block-reward).

## Block size limit

The maximum size in bytes that the consensus rules allow a block to be. The current block size limit is 2000000 bytes.

## Blocks-first sync

Synchronizing the block chain by downloading each block from a peer and then validating it.

## blocktransactions

A P2P Networking data structure used to provide some of the transactions in a block as requested.

## blocktransactionsrequest

A P2P Networking data structure used to list transaction indexes in a block being requested by a peer.

## Bloom filter

A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes.

## Chain code

In HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key

## ChainLock

ChainLocks are a feature enabling near instant consensus on the valid chain. ChainLocks use Long-Living Masternode Quorums to sign mined blocks. This mitigates 51 percent attacks and reduces uncertainty when receiving funds.

An output in a transaction which returns duffs to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees.

## Child key

In HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key. The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code.

## Child pays for parent

Selecting transactions for mining not just based on their fees but also based on the fees of their ancestors (parents) and descendants (children).

## Consensus rules

The block validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes.

The recommended specs for evonodes are higher than those for regular masternodes.
