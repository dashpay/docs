# Util RPCs

## CreateMultiSig

The [`createmultisig` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-util.md#createmultisig) creates a P2SH multi-signature address.

*Parameter #1---the number of signatures required*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Required | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The minimum (*m*) number of signatures required to spend this m-of-n multisig script

*Parameter #2---the full public keys*

:::{attention}
As of Dash Core 0.17.0, using addresses with `createmultisig` is unsupported. Clients must use [`addmultisigaddress`](../api/remote-procedure-calls-wallet.md#addmultisigaddress) to create multisig addresses.
:::

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Keys | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array of strings with each string being a public key
→<br>Key | string | Required<br>(1 or more) | A public key against which signatures will be checked. There must be at least as many keys as specified by the `Required` parameter, and there may be more keys

*Result---P2SH address and hex-encoded redeem script*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An object describing the multisig address
→<br>`address` | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The P2SH address for this multisig redeem script
→<br>`redeemScript` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The multisig redeem script encoded as hex
→<br>`descriptor` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The descriptor for this multisig

*Example from Dash Core 20.0.0*

Creating a 1-of-2 P2SH multisig address by combining two full public keys:

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet createmultisig 1 '''
  [
    "03283a224c2c014d1d0ef82b00470b6b277d71e227c0e2394f9baade5d666e57d3",

  ]
'''
```

Result:

``` json

## DeriveAddresses

*Added in Dash Core 18.0.0*

The [`deriveaddresses` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-util.md#deriveaddresses) derives one or more addresses corresponding to an output [descriptor](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).

Examples of output descriptors are:

| Descriptor format | Description |
| - | - |
| `pkh(<pubkey>)` | P2PKH outputs for the given pubkey |
| `sh(multi(<n>,<pubkey>,<pubkey>,...))` | P2SH-multisig outputs for the given threshold and pubkeys |
| `raw(<hex script>)` | Outputs whose scriptPubKey equals the specified hex scripts |

In the above, <pubkey> either refers to a fixed public key in hexadecimal notation, or to an xpub/xprv optionally followed by one or more path elements separated by "/", where "h" represents a hardened child key. For more information on output descriptors, see the documentation in the [doc/descriptors.md](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md) file.

*Parameter #1---the descriptor*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`descriptor` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The [descriptor](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)

*Parameter #2---range*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`range` | number | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | If a ranged descriptor is used, this specifies the end or the range (in [begin,end] notation) to derive (e.g. "[0,2]").

*Result---the derived addresses*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Array of derived addresses
→<br>Address | string | Required<br>(0 or more) | The derived address(es)

*Example from Dash Core 18.0.0*

Analyse a descriptor:

``` bash
dash-cli  deriveaddresses "pkh([8a54e0c5]0214889c34100d00aca6e7cbfe0fa72d83c28857585740bff5f3db6b37e51d9aaa)#wyvgzv2k"
```

Result:

A conservative estimate potentially returns a higher feerate and is more likely to be sufficient for the desired target, but is not as responsive to short term drops in the prevailing fee market.  Must be one of:<br>`UNSET` (defaults to `CONSERVATIVE`)<br>`ECONOMICAL`<br>`CONSERVATIVE`

*Result---the fee the transaction needs to pay per kilobyte*

## VerifyMessage

The [`verifymessage` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-util.md#verifymessage) verifies a signed message.

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Address | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The P2PKH address corresponding to the private key which made the signature.  A P2PKH address is a hash of the public key corresponding to the private key which made the signature.  When the ECDSA signature is checked, up to four possible ECDSA public keys will be reconstructed from from the signature; each key will be hashed and compared against the P2PKH address provided to see if any of them match.  If there are no matches, signature validation will fail

*Parameter #2---the signature*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Signature | string (base64) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The signature created by the signer encoded as base-64 (the format output by the [`signmessage` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-wallet.md#signmessage))

*Parameter #3---the message*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Message | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The message exactly as it was signed (e.g. no extra whitespace)

*Result: `true`, `false`, or an error*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | boolean | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to `true` if the message was signed by a key corresponding to the provided P2PKH address; set to `false` if it was not signed by that key; set to JSON `null` if an error occurred

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Check the signature on the message created in the example for
`signmessage`:

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet verifymessage \
  yNpezfFDfoikDuT1f4iK75AiLp2YLPsGAb \
  H4XULzfHCf16In2ECk9Ta9QxQPq639zQto2JA3OLlo3JbUdrClvJ89+A1z+Z9POd6l8LJhn1jGpQYF8mX4jkQvE= \
  'Hello, World!'
```

Result:

``` json
true
```

*See also*

* [SignMessage](../api/remote-procedure-calls-wallet.md#signmessage): signs a message with the private key of an address.
