# Network RPCs

## AddNode

The [`addnode` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-network.md#addnode) attempts to add or remove a node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a node once.

*Parameter #1---hostname/IP address and port of node to add or remove*

| Name   | Type   | Presence                | Description                                                       |

| `node` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The node to add as a string in the form of `<IP address>:<port>`. |

*Parameter #2---whether to add or remove the node, or to try only once to connect*

| Name      | Type   | Presence                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If currently connected, this will disconnect immediately<br>• `onetry` to immediately attempt connection to the node even if the outgoing connection slots are full; this will only attempt the connection once |

_Result---`null` plus error on failed remove_

| Name     | Type | Presence                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `result` | null | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Always JSON `null` whether the node was added, removed, tried-and-connected, or tried-and-not-connected.  The JSON-RPC error field will be set only if you try adding a node that was already added or removing a node that is not on the addnodes list |

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Try connecting to the following node.

```bash
dash-cli -testnet addnode 192.0.2.113:19999 onetry

## ListBanned

*Added in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0*

The [`listbanned` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-network.md#listbanned) lists all ***manually banned*** IPs/Subnets.

:::{note}
Dash Core 18.1.0 introduced changes to how misbehaving peers are treated. As a result they are no longer included in this RPC response. See the [release notes](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v18.1.0/doc/release-notes.md#changes-regarding-misbehaving-peers) for additional details.

## Ping

The [`ping` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-network.md#ping) sends a P2P ping message to all connected nodes to measure ping time. Results are provided by the [`getpeerinfo` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-network.md#getpeerinfo) pingtime and pingwait fields as decimal seconds. The P2P [`ping` message](../reference/p2p-network-control-messages.md#ping) is handled in a queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping.

*Parameters: none*

_Result---`null`_

| Name     | Type | Presence | Description        |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------ |
| `result` | null | Required | Always JSON `null` |

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

```bash
dash-cli -testnet ping
```

(Success: no result printed.)

Get the results using the [`getpeerinfo` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-network.md#getpeerinfo):

```bash
dash-cli -testnet getpeerinfo | grep ping
```

Results:

```json
        "pingtime" : 0.11790800,
        "pingtime" : 0.22673400,
