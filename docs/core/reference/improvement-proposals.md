# Improvement Proposals

## Dash (DIPs)

Similar to Bitcoin's BIPs, a Dash Improvement Proposal ([DIP](https://github.com/dashpay/dips)) is a design document for providing information to the Dash community, or describing a new feature for Dash processes/environment. The DIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Dash DIP repository</a> for details on the status of existing DIPs.

## Bitcoin (BIPs)

A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a design document providing information to the Bitcoin community, or describing a new feature for Bitcoin or its processes or environment.

Since Dash is forked from Bitcoin, some BIPs are applicable to both. Dash-specific BIP information can be found in <a href="https://github.com/dashevo/bips/blob/master/README.mediawiki" target="_blank">Dash's BIP repository</a>.The repository provides a list of the BIPs that are relevant to Dash. Note that some BIPs may only be partially implemented or modified to meet Dash requirements. The `Dash Status` column indicates if any changes were made.
