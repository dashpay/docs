# Raw Transaction Format

Dash transactions are broadcast between [peers](../resources/glossary.md#peer) in a serialized byte format, called [raw format](../resources/glossary.md#raw-format). It is this form of a transaction which is SHA256(SHA256()) hashed to create the [TXID](../resources/glossary.md#transaction-identifiers) and, ultimately, the [merkle root](../resources/glossary.md#merkle-root) of a [block](../resources/glossary.md#block) containing the transaction---making the transaction format part of the [consensus rules](../resources/glossary.md#consensus-rules).

Dash Core and many other tools print and accept [raw transactions](../resources/glossary.md#raw-transaction) encoded as hex.

Transactions prior to protocol version 70209 defaulted to version 1. Transaction version 2 was the default in protocol versions => 70209 and < 70213. Version 2 transactions have the same format, but the `lock_time` parameter was redefined by [BIP68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) to enable relative lock-times. (Note: transactions in the [block chain](../resources/glossary.md#block-chain) are allowed to list a higher version number to permit [soft forks](../resources/glossary.md#soft-fork), but they are treated as version 2 transactions by current software.)

Dash Core 0.13.0 (protocol version 70213) introduced transaction version 3 as part of the [DIP2 - Special Transactions](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md) implementation. Details of the changes introduced by this feature and currently implemented [special transactions](../resources/glossary.md#special-transactions) can be found in the [Special Transactions section](../reference/transactions-special-transactions.md) below as well as in the [DIP](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md).

A raw transaction has the following top-level format:

| Bytes    | Name         | Data Type           | Description
|----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------
| 2        | version      | uint16_t            | *Converted from 4 bytes to 2 bytes by DIP2 in v0.13.0*<br><br>Transaction version number; currently version 3.  Programs creating transactions using newer consensus rules may use higher version numbers.
| 2        | type         | uint16_t            | *Added by DIP2 in v0.13.0. Uses 2 bytes that were previously part of `version`*<br><br>Transaction type number; 0 for classical transactions; Non-zero for DIP2 special transactions.
| *Varies* | tx_in count  | compactSize uint    | Number of inputs in this transaction.
| *Varies* | tx_in        | txIn                | Transaction inputs.  See description of txIn below.
| *Varies* | tx_out count | compactSize uint    | Number of outputs in this transaction.
| *Varies* | tx_out       | txOut               | Transaction outputs.  See description of txOut below.
| 4        | lock_time    | uint32_t            | A time (Unix epoch time) or block number.  See the [locktime parsing rules](../guide/transactions-locktime-and-sequence-number.md).
| *Varies* | extra_payload size | compactSize uint | *Added by DIP2 in v0.13.0*<br><br>Variable number of bytes of extra payload for DIP2-based special transactions
| *Varies* | extra_payload | blob               | *Added by DIP2 in v0.13.0*<br><br>Special transaction payload.

A transaction may have multiple [inputs](../resources/glossary.md#input) and [outputs](../resources/glossary.md#output), so the txIn and txOut structures may recur within a transaction. [CompactSize unsigned integers](../resources/glossary.md#compactsize) are a form of variable-length integers; they are described in the [CompactSize section](../reference/transactions-compactsize-unsigned-integers.md).

## JSON-RPC Responses

When retrieving transaction data via Dash Core RPCs (e.g. the [`getrawtransaction` RPC](../api/remote-procedure-calls-raw-transactions.md#getrawtransaction)), the transaction data is returned in the following format.

Version 1 and 2 Transaction Structure (prior to DIP2 activation in Dash Core v0.13.0):

``` json
{
  "txid": "<string>",
  "size": "<int>",
  "version": 2,
  "locktime": 0,
  "vin": [ ],
  "vout": [ ]
}
```

Version 3 Transaction Structure (Dash Core v0.13.0+ and activated [DIP2](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md)):

``` json
{
  "txid": "<string>",
  "size": "<int>",
  "version": 3,
  "type": "<int>",
  "locktime": 0,
  "vin": [ ],
  "vout": [ ],
  "extraPayloadSize": "<variable int>",
  "extraPayload": "â€¦"
}
```

For [special transactions](../resources/glossary.md#special-transactions) (those using the extraPayload fields), JSON-RPC responses contain a parsed JSON representation of the Transaction Payload.

The sample transaction below shows the response for a quorum commitment special transaction:

``` json

## TxIn: A Transaction Input (Non-Coinbase)

Each non- [coinbase](../resources/glossary.md#coinbase) [input](../resources/glossary.md#input) spends an outpoint from a previous transaction. (Coinbase inputs are described separately after the example section below.)

| Bytes    | Name             | Data Type            | Description
|----------|------------------|----------------------|--------------
| 36       | previous_output  | [outpoint](../resources/glossary.md#outpoint)             | The previous outpoint being spent.  See description of outpoint below.
| *Varies* | script bytes     | compactSize uint     | The number of bytes in the signature script.  Maximum is 10,000 bytes.
| *Varies* | signature script | char[]               | A script-language script which satisfies the conditions placed in the outpoint's pubkey script.  Should only contain data pushes; see the [signature script modification warning](../reference/transactions-opcodes.md#signature-script-modification).
| 4        | sequence         | uint32_t             | Sequence number.  Default for Dash Core and almost all other programs is 0xffffffff.

**<span id="outpoint"></span>**

## Outpoint: The Specific Part Of A Specific Output

Because a single transaction can include multiple [outputs](../resources/glossary.md#output), the [outpoint](../resources/glossary.md#outpoint) structure includes both a [TXID](../resources/glossary.md#transaction-identifiers) and an output index number to refer to specific output.

| Bytes | Name  | Data Type | Description
|-------|-------|-----------|--------------
| 32    | hash  | char[32]  | The TXID of the transaction holding the output to spend.  The TXID is a hash provided here in internal byte order.
| 4     | index | uint32_t  | The output index number of the specific output to spend from the transaction. The first output is 0x00000000.

**<span id="txout"></span>**

## TxOut: A Transaction Output

Each [output](../resources/glossary.md#output) spends a certain number of [duffs](../resources/glossary.md#duffs), placing them under control of anyone who can satisfy the provided [pubkey script](../resources/glossary.md#pubkey-script).

| Bytes    | Name            | Data Type        | Description
|----------|-----------------|------------------|--------------
| 8        | value           | int64_t          | Number of duffs to spend.  May be zero; the sum of all outputs may not exceed the sum of duffs previously spent to the outpoints provided in the input section.  (Exception: coinbase transactions spend the block subsidy and collected transaction fees.)
| 1+       | pk_script bytes | compactSize uint | Number of bytes in the pubkey script.  Maximum is 10,000 bytes.
| *Varies* | pk_script       | char[]           | Defines the conditions which must be satisfied to spend this output.

**Example**

The sample raw transaction itemized below is the one created in the [Simple Raw Transaction section](../examples/transaction-tutorial-simple-raw-transaction.md) of the Developer Examples. It spends a previous pay-to-pubkey output by paying to a new pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH) output.

## Coinbase Input: The Input Of The First Transaction In A Block

The first transaction in a [block](../resources/glossary.md#block), called the [coinbase transaction](../resources/glossary.md#coinbase-transaction), must have exactly one input, called a [coinbase](../resources/glossary.md#coinbase). The coinbase [input](../resources/glossary.md#input) currently has the following format.

| Bytes    | Name               | Data Type            | Description
|----------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------
| 32       | hash (null)        | char[32]             | A 32-byte null, as a coinbase has no previous outpoint.
| 4        | index (UINT32_MAX) | uint32_t             | 0xffffffff, as a coinbase has no previous outpoint.
| *Varies* | script bytes       | compactSize uint     | The number of bytes in the coinbase script, up to a maximum of 100 bytes.
| *Varies* (4) | height         | script               | The [block height](../resources/glossary.md#block-height) of this block as required by BIP34.  Uses script language: starts with a data-pushing opcode that indicates how many bytes to push to the stack followed by the block height as a little-endian unsigned integer.  This script must be as short as possible, otherwise it may be rejected.<br><br>  The data-pushing opcode will be 0x03 and the total size four bytes until block 16,777,216 about 300 years from now.
| *Varies* | coinbase script    | *None*               | The [coinbase field](../resources/glossary.md#coinbase): Arbitrary data not exceeding 100 bytes minus the (4) height bytes.  Miners commonly place an extra nonce in this field to update the block header merkle root during hashing.
| 4        | sequence           | uint32_t             | Sequence number.

Although the coinbase script is arbitrary data, if it includes the bytes used by any signature-checking operations such as [`OP_CHECKSIG`](../reference/transactions-opcodes.md), those signature checks will be counted as signature operations (sigops) towards the block's sigop limit.  To avoid this, you can prefix all data with the appropriate push operation.

An itemized [coinbase transaction](../resources/glossary.md#coinbase-transaction):

``` text

| | f33e64d102c9591a88ac ................ P2PKH script
|
| 00000000 ............................ Locktime
```

Note: currently the normal coinbase has 2 outputs (1 for the [miner](../resources/glossary.md#miner) and 1 for the selected [masternode](../resources/glossary.md#masternode)). Superblocks ([superblock example](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/block.dws?731104.htm)) have multiple outputs depending on the number of proposals being funded.
