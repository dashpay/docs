# Transifex

Transifex is used to support multiple languages. The scripts in this folder
assist with pushing data for translators to Transifex and retrieving translated
information.

## Install required packages

``` shell
pip install sphinx-intl
pip install transifex-client==0.13.12
```

## Set webhook variables

The `build.sh` script requires Transifex webhook token and URL values. These
should be defined in a `.env` file. See [.env.example](.env.example) for an
example of the format.

## Usage

Using the scripts requires adding a Transifex API token to an account that has
access to the project as mention in the [Transifex client documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction#authenticating).

It is also necessary to add authorization information in a `.transifexrc` file
as shown in this example:

```text
[https://www.transifex.com]
api_hostname = https://api.transifex.com
hostname = https://www.transifex.com
password = <enter password generated on https://www.transifex.com/user/settings/api/ here>
username = api
```

### To upload to Transifex

Run the following from the root of the project to upload to Transifex:

``` bash
./transifex/pushtx.sh
```

### To retrieve from Transifex

Next run the following to retrieve the translation updates:

``` bash
./transifex/pulltx.sh
```

### To build localized sites

Make sure the webhook variables are accessible. Run the following in the folder
containing your `.env` file:

``` bash
source .env
```

Next run the following to trigger builds for each language on ReadTheDocs:

``` bash
./transifex/build.sh
```
