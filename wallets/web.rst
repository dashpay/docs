`MyDashWallet <https://mydashwallet.org/>`_ is a web interface to the
Dash blockchain, inspired by `MyEtherWallet
<https://www.myetherwallet.com>`_ and created by `DeltaEngine.net
<https://deltaengine.net/>`_. It is explicitly not an online wallet,
meaning you maintain control over your private keys at all times. Unlike
many other light wallets, MyDashWallet also supports advanced Dash
features such as InstantSend and CoinJoin. The project is non-profit,
open source and free to use. You can load a wallet and transact in a
variety of wallet formats:

- Keystore wallet (file-based)
- Ledger hardware wallet
- Trezor hardware wallet
- Private key
- BIP39/44 HD recovery phrase (coming soon)
- BIP32 HD recovery phrase (coming soon)

Please note that web wallets may not be as secure as alternatives such
as hardware wallets. Be aware of the risk of storing large amounts of
Dash in keyfile wallets, since they are an easier target to attack than
mobile or hardware wallets. 

MyDashWallet offers complete and detailed documentation for all functions.
