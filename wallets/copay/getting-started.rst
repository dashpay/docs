Getting Started
===============

This documentation describes how to use the most common features of the
Dash Copay wallet. Since the functionality is similar across all
supported platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux), the
instructions and screenshots will reference the Android software,
highlighting differences between the platforms where necessary.

The easiest way to install the Dash Copay for Android is from the
Google Play Store.

Dash Copay for iOS is available through Apple TestFlight. To join the
list of testers, send an email to elizabeth.robuck@dash.org with your
Apple Account ID.

For other platforms, or to view and compile the source code yourself,
please see the instructions on 
`GitHub <https://github.com/dashevo/dash-copay>`__.

Installation
============

When you first start your Dash Copay Wallet, you will be prompted to
choose between creating a new wallet or restoring an existing wallet
from backup. Choose **Get Started** to create a new wallet, unless you
have existing funds stored in another wallet using a recovery phrase.
When prompted, enter and confirm a spending password to encrypt your
wallet keys. You will need this password every time you want to send
Dash from your wallet. At this point, you will be offered a chance to
back up your wallet using a recovery phrase. It is highly recommended to
do this immediately by tapping the **Backup wallet** button. Acknowledge
the warnings, enter your password and write down the displayed recovery
phrase on paper. Do not take a screenshot, since your device will likely
make a copy on cloud storage, which is not necessarily under your
personal control. Confirm the recovery phrase and terms of use. Your
Dash Copay wallet is now ready to go!

If you want to restore an existing Dash Copay wallet, simply tap
**Restore from backup** and enter the 12 word recovery phrase. File/text
backups are also supported.

Receiving
=========

Simply tap the **Receive** icon at the bottom of the screen to receive
Dash. The wallet will generate and display a QR code for the other
device to scan, or you can tap the displayed address to copy it to the
clipboard so you can paste it in another app. If you have multiple
wallets, you can see the name of the wallet at the bottom of the screen,
and tap it to switch between wallets. The receiving address will change
and you will receive a notification when you receive the transfer.

Sending
=======

Depending on how your payee has provided their receiving address to you,
you can send Dash by tapping either the **Scan** icon to use the device
camera to scan a QR code, or the **Send** icon to paste a copied address
or select an address from your Dash Copay address book. Once you have
entered the address, it may be possible or necessary to enter the amount
of Dash to be sent or an optional label for the recipient, and to decide
if you want to send with InstantSend on or off (off by default). If you
have multiple wallets, you must also choose which wallet you will use to
send the funds. Once the transaction is complete, you will see a payment
confirmation screen.

Viewing transactions and balances
=================================

Your recent transactions appear on the **Home** screen. You can tap any
transaction to view more details or enter a **Memo** to help you
remember the purpose of the transaction. Tap **View on blockchain** to
open the Insight blockchain explorer to view full transaction details.
All the wallets you have created and their respective balances appear
below the recent transactions on the **Home** screen. You can tap any
wallet to view the balance and transaction history associated with that
wallet only.
