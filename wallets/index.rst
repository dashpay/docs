Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is
necessary. This applies to barter systems as well as economies using
currency as a medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a
private ledger, cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses
on a distributed public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access
the balance stored on each public address are therefore the object of
value in this system. This section of the documentation discusses
different practical methods of keeping these keys safe in wallets, while
still remaining useful for day-to-day needs.

For safety, it is not recommended to store significant funds on
exchanges or software wallets. If you are holding cryptocurrency worth
more than the device you use to store it, you should purchase a
