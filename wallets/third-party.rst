Introduction
============

The Dash protocol and many Dash products such as Dash Core and the
mobile wallets are entirely open source, which makes it easy for third
parties to integrate Dash with their existing cryptocurrency wallet
solutions. This section describes some of the third party wallets
available and the functions they offer. Please note that Dash does not
provide support for any of these wallets, and any listing here should
not be considered an endorsement or recommendation. Contact the software
vendor for support.
